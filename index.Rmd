This book covers the the skills and techniques necessary for creating sophisticated and accessible interactive web applications. It focuses on the client-side languages, tools, and libraries that professionals use to build the web sites you use every day. It assumes a basic background in computer programming (e.g., one [course](https://www.cs.washington.edu/142/) in Java, and some concepts from the [technical foundations of informatics](https://info201.github.io)). These materials were developed for the **INFO 343: Client-Side Web Development** course taught at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/); however they have been structured to be an online resource for anyone who wishes to learn modern web programming techniques.
