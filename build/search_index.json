[["index.html", "Client-Side Web Development About the Book", " Client-Side Web Development Joel Ross and Mike Freeman November 15, 2022 About the Book About the Book This book covers the the skills and techniques necessary for creating sophisticated and accessible interactive web applications. It focuses on the client-side languages, tools, and libraries that professionals use to build the web sites you use every day. It assumes a basic background in computer programming (e.g., one course in Java, and some concepts from the technical foundations of informatics). These materials were developed for the INFO 340: Client-Side Web Development course taught at the University of Washington Information School; however they have been structured to be an online resource for anyone who wishes to learn modern web programming techniques. Some content has been adapted from tutorials by David Stearns. This book is currently in alpha status. Visit us on GitHub to contribute improvements.

"],["machine-setup.html", "Chapter 1 Getting Setup 1.1 Web Browser 1.2 Code Editors 1.3 Bash (Command Line) 1.4 Git and GitHub 1.5 Node and npm Resources", " Chapter 1 Getting Setup This course will cover a wide variety of tools and techniques used in modern web development, including different software programs that are used to write, manage, and execute the code for your web application. This chapter explains how to install and use some of the software you will need to utilize. Note that iSchool lab machines should have all appropriate software already installed and ready to use. In summary, you’ll need to install and set up the following software on your machine (more information below on each of these). Feel free to use alternative software, but these are the suggested programs for the course (i.e., the ones which we will provide support for): A modern web browser such as Google Chrome Visual Studio Code as your code editor Node.js as a JavaScript engine npm as a JavaScript package manager (comes with Node.js) git as a version control system (for Windows users; already installed on Macs) A Bash terminal (e.g., the Git Bash for Windows; Terminal is already installed on Macs) 1.1 Web Browser The first thing you’ll need is a web browser for viewing the web pages you make! We recommend you install and utilize Chrome, which comes with an effective set of built-in developer tools that will be especially useful in this class. We recommend Chrome primarily for historical reasons (and because it is the browser used by the authors—and we had to pick one!) You can access the Chrome Developer tools by selecting View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools from Chrome’s main menu (cmd + option + i on a Mac, ctrl + shift + i on Windows). You will pretty much always want to have these tools open when doing web development, especially when including interactivity via JavaScript. Other modern browsers such as Firefox or Microsoft Edge will also function perfectly well in this course and include their own versions of the required development tools. Note that different browsers may and will render code in different ways, which will be discussed extensively throughout the course. We strongly suggest that you don’t use Safari, as it has a number of user interface and rendering issues that make it difficult to develop with for this course. 1.2 Code Editors In order to write web code, you need somewhere to write it. There are a variety of code editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that are specialized for web development, providing syntax highlighting, code completion, and other useful functionality. There are lots of different code editors out there, all of which have slightly different appearances and features. You only need to download and use one of the following programs (we recommend Visual Studio Code as a default), but feel free to try out different ones to find something you like (and then evangelize about it to your friends!) Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code (or VS Code; not to be confused with Visual Studio) is a free, open-source editor developed by Microsoft—yes, really. It focuses on web programming and JavaScript, though also supports many other languages and provides a number of community-built extensions for adding even more features. Although fairly new, it is updated regularly and has has become one of our main editors for programming. VS Code is actually a stand-alone web application, so it’s written in the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you’ll learn in this course! To install VS Code, follow the above link and Click the “Download” button to download the installer (e.g, .exe) file, then double-click on that to install the application. Once you’ve installed VS Code, the trick to using it effectively is to get comfortable with the Command Palette. If you hit cmd + shift + p, VS Code will open a small dialog where you can search for whatever you want the editor to do. For example, if you type in markdown you can get list of commands related to Markdown files (including the ability to open up a preview). The Format Code option is particularly useful. For more information about using VS Code, see the documentation, which includes videos if you find them useful. The documentation for programming in HTML, CSS, and especially JavaScript also contain lots of tips and tricks. While we suggest using VSCode for this course, other editors are also acceptable and may be of interest to you. Atom Atom is a text editor built by the folks at GitHub and has been gaining in popularity. It is very similar to VS Code in terms of features, but has a somewhat different interface and community. It has a similar command-palette to VS Code. The document you are reading was authored in Atom. Brackets Brackets is a coding editor created by Adobe specialized for client-side web developers. It has some intriguing features that are not yet in Visual Studio Code, as well as possibly the nicest interface of this list. Sublime Text Sublime Text is a very popular text editor with excellent defaults and a variety of available extensions (though you’ll need to manage and install extensions to achieve the functionality offered by other editors out of the box). While the software can be used for free, every 20 or so saves it will prompt you to purchase the full version. This is a great option to write a plain text file. 1.3 Bash (Command Line) Many of the software tools used in professional web development are used on the command line: a text-based interface for controlling your computer. While the command line is harder to learn and figure out, it is particularly effective for doing web development. Command line automation is powerful and efficient enough to handle the dozens of repeated tasks across hundreds of different source files (split across multiple computers) commonly found in web programming. You will need to be comfortable using the command line in order to utilize the software for this course. While there are multiple different command shells (command line interfaces), this course uses the Bash shell, which provides a particular common set of commands common to Mac and Linux machines. On a Mac you’ll want to use the built-in app called Terminal. You can open it by searching via Spotlight (hit Cmd (⌘) and Spacebar together, type in “terminal”, then select the app to open it), or by finding it in the Applications/Utilities folder. As of macOS Catalina, Macs use zsh as the default command shell with Terminal. This works mostly the same as bash (supporting generally the same command). It is also possible to switch between the two shells if needed. On Windows, you can use the Git Bash shell, which you should install along with git (see below). Open this program to open the command-shell. Note that Windows does come with its own command-prompt, called the Command Prompt (previously the DOS Prompt), but it has a different set of commands and features. Powershell is a more powerful version of the Command Prompt if you really want to get into the Windows Management Framework. But Bash is more common in open-source programming like we’ll be doing, and so we will be focusing on that set of commands. Alternatively, you can set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This will let you turn the Windows command prompt into a full-blown Bash shell just by typing the command bash. (Technically you’re running a small copy of the Linux operating system inside of your Windows install, but we’re just going to need the Bash shell). Follow the linked instructions for installing this system. Note that you’ll need to pay attention to file paths if you use WSL, as by default the current working directory is set to the Linux partition rather than your Windows partition. This course expects you to already be familiar with basic command line usage. For review, see The Command Line in the INFO 201 course reader. 1.4 Git and GitHub Professional web development involves many different people working on many different files. git is a collaborative version control system that provides a set of commands that allow you to manage changes to written code, particularly when collaborating with other programmers. You will need to download and install the software. If you are on a Mac, git should already be installed. If you are using a Windows machine, then installing git will also install the Git Bash command shell. Note that git is a command line application: you can test that it is installed by running the command: git --version While git is the software used to manage versions of code, GitHub is a website that is used to store copies of computer code that are being managed with git (think “Imgur for code”). In order to use GitHub, you’ll need to create a free GitHub account, if you don’t already have one. You should register a username that is identifiable as you (e.g., based on your name or your UW NetID). This will make it easier for others to determine out who contributed what code, rather than needing to figure out who ‘LeetDesigner2099’ is. This can be the start of a professional account you may use for the rest of your career! Note that you can have git save your GitHub password on your local machine so you don’t have to type it repeatedly. See Authenticating with GitHub from Git. This course expects you to already be familiar with utilizing Git and GitHub. For review, see Git and GitHub, Git Branches, and Git Collaboration in the INFO 201 course reader. Note that students in the INFO 340 course will be using GitHub and Pull Requests to turn in programming assignments. 1.5 Node and npm Node.js (commonly just “Node”) is a a command line runtime environment for the JavaScript programming language—that is, a program that is used to interpret and execute programming instructions written in JavaScript. Although client-side development usually involves running JavaScript in the browser (see Chapter: JavaScript), Node provides a platform for installing and running a wide variety of “helper” programs that are frequently used in web development. The easiest way to install Node is to use the installer from Nodejs.org. I recommend getting the latest version for this course. Download the installer and execute it to set up Node on your machine. If you want more control over your machine and Node versions, you can alternatively install Node using nvm, the Node Version Manager. This is a command line program that manages installing the Node command line program, but also makes it easy to update or adjust your Node installation. (It also installs the same way on Mac or Windows WSL). See the installation instructions for details. You can test that Node is installed and working by opening your command shell and running node --version Be sure and check that you have a recent enough version! At time of this writing, you should have Node v17 or later. Installing Node also installs an additional command line program called npm. npm is a package manager, or a program used to “manage” other programs—think of it as a command line “app store” for developer tools and libraries. npm is the most common way of installing and running a large number of tools used in professional web development. At the time of writing, the npm “registry” lists around 725,000 different packages. If you have an older version of Node and npm (before Node 10.16 or npm 5.6), you will need to update them. You can re-install the latest version of Node as above, or just upgrade npm using the command npm install npm@latest -g. See below for an explanation of this command. Managing packages with npm You can use the npm program to download and install command line programs by name: # syntax to globally install package with npm npm install -g PACKAGE-NAME For example, you could install the Jest testing application (a program for running automated tests) used in this course using: # globally install the Jest package npm install -g jest Importantly, note the included -g option. This tells npm that the package should be installed globally, making it available across the entire computer, rather than just from a particular folder. Because you want to be able to use a command line program like Jest from any folder (e.g., for any project), command line utilities are always installed globally with the -g option. Installing an application globally requires administrator permissions. If you try to install something without admin permission, you’ll get an error saying permission denied: A permission denied error when installing with npm In order to install programs globally, you will need to use the sudo (superuser do) command to run the install as an administrator. You do this by putting sudo in front of the command you want to run, for example: # as an administrator, globally install the Jest package sudo npm install -g jest You will be prompted for your computer’s password, make sure to fill that in (even though you won’t see any typing occur). Note that you should only use sudo when necessary (e.g., when you hit this error); don’t run every command as an administrator! After an application is installed, you can run it from the command line by typing the name of that program followed by any arguments. For example, you can have the Jest program print it’s version: # get the version of the installed Jest application jest --version The latest version of npm also comes with an additional program called npx. This application lets you “download and run” an application with installing it separately. For example, you could download and run Jest to see it’s version: # download and run the Jest application without installing it separately npx jest --version It is also possible to install packages locally by omitting the -g argument. For example: npm install lodash Will download the lodash code library (a set of useful JavaScript functions). This package will be placed into a new folder in the current project directory called node_modules/, and can be imported and used in the current directory’s code. (It’s called a local install because the package is only available to the “local” project). You will of course need to install local packages once per project. Because node packages can be very large, and projects can have lots of them, you want to be sure to not commit the node_modules/ folder to version control. Make sure that the folder is listed in your .gitignore file! package.json As projects become large, it is common for them to build up many dependencies: packages that must be installed in order for the program to work. In other words, there needs to be a certain set of packages in the project’s node_modules/ folder. npm is able to keep track of these dependencies by recording them in a specialized file called package.json that can be placed inside the project directory. A package.json file is a text file containing a JSON list of information about your project. For example: { \"name\": \"example\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"private\": true, \"description\": \"A project with an example package.json\", \"main\": \"index.js\", \"scripts\": { \"test\": \"jest\" }, \"author\": \"Joel Ross\", \"license\": \"ISC\", \"dependencies\": { \"lodash\": \"^4.17.4\", \"moment\": \"^2.18.1\" }, \"devDependencies\": { \"html-validator\": \"^2.2.2\" } } (You can create one of these files by using the command npm init in the current project directory, and then following the instructions to fill in the fields). Notice that there are two packages listed under \"dependencies\": lodash and moment (the ^4.17.4 indicates which version of lodash). You can use npm to automatically install all of the packages listed under \"dependencies\" (as well as under \"devDependencies\") using the command: npm install Thus using npm install without any arguments means “install all of the requirements that have been listed for this project”. This is a good first step any time you download a project or checkout a repository from GitHub. When installing specific packages, npm automatically adds them to the dependencies list in the package.json, though you can make this explicit with the --save option: # explicitly save dependency in package.json npm install --save lodash Similarly, the --save-dev option will instead save the package in the \"devDependencies\" list, which are dependencies needed only for development (writing the program’s code) and not for execution (running the program). You can uninstall packages using npm uninstall, or can remove packages from the dependencies lists simply by editing the package.json file (e.g., with VS Code). To sum up, you will use three commands with npm to install packages: npm install -g PACKAGE-NAME to globally install command line programs. npm install to locally install all of the dependencies for a project you check out. npm install PACKAGE-NAME to locally install a new code package and record it in the package.json file. While npm is the most popular package manager (and the one utilized in this course), there are others as well. For example, Yarn is a package manager created by Facebook that is compatible with npm and is quickly growing in popularity. Note that you will generally need to use one package manager or other; don’t try to mix them in a single project!

However, the internet is a network involving many different computers all communicating with one another. These computers can be divided into two different groups: servers store (“host”) content and provide (“serve”) it to other computers, while clients request that content and then present it to the human users. Consider the process of viewing a basic web page, such as the Wikipedia entry on Informatics. In order to visit this page, the user types the web address (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics) into the URL bar, or clicks on a link to go to the page. In either case, the user’s computer is the client, and their browser takes that address or link and uses it to create an HTTP Request—a request for data sent following the HyperText Transfer Protocol. This request is like a letter asking for information, and is sent to a different computer: the web server that contains that information. A diagram of client/server communication. The web server will receive this request, and based on its content (e.g., the parameters of the URL) will decide what information to send as a response to the client. In general, this response will be made up of lots of different files: the text content of the web page, styling information (font, color) for how it should look, instructions for responding to user interaction (button clicks), images or other assets to show, and so forth. The client’s web browser will then take all of these different files in the response and use them to render the web page for the user to see: it will determine what text to show, what font and color to make that text, where to put the images, and is ready to do something else when the user clicks on one of those images. Indeed, a web browser is just a computer program that is able to send HTTP requests on behalf of the user, and then render the resulting response. Given this interaction, client-side web development involves implementing programs (writing code) that are interpreted by the browser, and are executed by the client. It is authoring the code that is sent in the server’s response. This code specifies how websites should appear and how the user should interact with them. On the other hand, server-side web development involves implementing programs that the server uses to determine which client-side code is delivered. As an example, a server-side program contains the logic to determine which cat picture should be sent along with the request, while a client-side program contains the logic about where and how that picture should appear on the page. This course focuses on client-side web development, or developing programs that are executed by the browser (generally as a response to a web server request). While we will cover how client-side programs can interact with a server, many of the concepts discussed here can also be run inside a browser without relying on an external server (called “running locally”, since the code is run on the local machine). 2.1 Client-Side File Types It is the web browser’s job to interpret and render the source code files sent by a server as part of an HTTP response. As a client-side web programmer, your task is to write this source code for the browser to interpret. There are multiple different types of source code files, including: .html files containing code written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language). This code will specify the textual and semantic content of the web page. See the chapter HTML Fundamentals for details on HTML. .css files containing code written in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This code is used to specify styling and visual appearance properties (e.g., color and font) for the HTML content. See the chapter CSS Fundamentals for details on CSS. .js files containing code written in JavaScript. This code is used to specify interactive behaviors that the website will perform—for example, what should change when the user clicks a button. Note that JavaScript code are “programs” that sent over by the web server as part of the response, but are executed on the client’s computer. See the chapter JavaScript Fundamentals for details on JavaScript. HTTP responses may also include additional asset files, such as images (.png, .jpg, .gif, etc), fonts, video or music files, etc. 2.2 HTTP Requests and Servers Modern web browsers are able to render (interpret and display) all of these types of files, combining them together into the modern, interactive web pages you use every day. In fact, you can open up almost any file inside a web browser, such as by right-clicking on the file and selecting “Open With”, or dragging the file into the browser program. HTML files act as the basis for web pages, so you can open a .html file inside your web browser by double-clicking on it (the same way you would open a .docx file in MS Word): An very simple HTML file. See Chapter 3 for source code. Consider the URL bar in the above browser. The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is actually a specialized version of a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). URIs act a lot like the address on a postal letter sent within a large organization such as a university: you indicate the business address as well as the department and the person, and will get a different response (and different data) from Alice in Accounting than from Sally in Sales. Note that the URI is the identifier (think: variable name) for the resource, while the resource is the actual data value (the file) that you want to access. Like postal letter addresses, URIs have a very specific format used to direct the request to the right resource. The format (schema) of a URI. The parts of this URI format include: scheme (also protocol): the “language” that the computer will use to send the request for the resource (file). In the example browser window above, the protocol is file, meaning that the computer is accessing the resource from the file system. When sending requests to web servers, you would use https (secure HTTP). Don’t use insecure http! Web page hyperlinks often include URIs with the mailto protocol for email links, or the tel protocol for phone numbers. domain: the address of the web server to request information from. You can think of this as the recipient of the request letter. In the browser window example, there is no domain because the file protocol doesn’t require it, but for most web URIs this would be the address (e.g., google.com or ischool.uw.edu). port (optional): used to determine where to connect to the web server. By default, web requests use port 80, but some web servers accept connections on other ports—e.g., 8080, 8000 and 3000 are all common on development servers, described below. path: which resource on that web server you wish to access. For the file protocol, this is the absolute path to the file on your computer. But even when using https, for many web servers, this will be the relative path to the file, starting from the “root” folder of that server (which may not be the computer’s root folder). For example, if a server used /Users/joelross/ as its root, then the path to the above HTML file would be Desktop/index.html (e.g., https://domain/Desktop/index.html). Important! If you specify a path to a folder rather than a file (including / as the “root” folder), most web servers will serve the file named index.html from that folder (i.e., the path “defaults” to index.html). As such, this is the traditional name for the HTML file containing a website’s home page. As in any program, you should always use relative paths in web programming, and these paths are frequently (but not always!) relative to the web server’s root folder. query (optional): extra parameters (arguments) included in the request about what resource to access. The leading ? is part of the query. fragment (optional): indicates which part (“fragment”) of the resource to access. This is used for example to let the user “jump” to the middle of a web page. The leading # is part of the fragment. Development Servers As noted above, it is possible to request a .html file (open a web page) using the file protocol by simply opening that file directly in the browser. This works fine for testing many client-side programs. However, there are a few client-side interactions that for security reasons only work if a web page is requested from a web server (e.g., via the http or https protocol). For this reason, it is recommended that you develop client-side web applications using a local development web server. This is a web server that you run from your own computer—your machine acts as a web server, and you use the browser to have your computer send a request to itself for the webpage. Think of it as mailing yourself a letter. Development web servers can help get around cross-origin request restrictions, as well as offer additional benefits to speed development—such as automatically reloading the web browser when the source code changes. There are many different ways to run a simple development server from the command line (such as using the Python http.server module). These servers, when started, will “serve” files using the current directory as the “root” folder. So again, if you start a server from /Users/joelross, you will be able to access the Desktop/index.html file at http://127.0.0.1:port/Desktop/index.html (which port will depend on which development server you use). The address 127.0.0.1 is the IP address for localhost which is the domain of your local machine (the “local host”). Most development servers, when started, will tell you the URL for the server’s root directory. Most commonly, you will want to start the web server from the root directory of your project, so that the relative path index.html finds the file you expect. You can usually stop a command line development server with the universal ctrl + c cancel command. Otherwise, you’ll want to leave the server running in a background terminal as long as you are working on your project. If you use the recommended live-server utility, it will open a web browser to the root folder and automatically reload the page whenever you save changes to a file in that folder. This will make your life much, much better. "],["html-fundamentals.html", "Chapter 3 HTML Fundamentals 3.1 HTML Elements 3.2 Nesting Elements 3.3 Web Page Structure 3.4 Web Page Template Resources", " Chapter 3 HTML Fundamentals A webpage on the internet is simply a set of files that the browser renders (shows) in a particular way, allowing you to interact with it. The most basic way to control how a browser displays content (e.g., words, images, etc) is by encoding that content in HTML. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a language that is used to give meaning to otherwise plain text, which the browser can then use to determine how to display that text. HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language: it adds additional details to information (like notes in the margin of a book), but doesn’t contain any logic. HTML is a “hypertext” markup language because it was originally intended to mark up a document with hyperlinks, or links to other documents. In modern usage, HTML describes the semantic meaning of content: it marks what content is a heading, what content is a paragraph, what content is a definition, what content is an image, what content is a hyperlink, and so forth. HTML serves a similar function to the Markdown markup language, but is much more expressive and powerful. This chapter provides an overview and explanation of HTML’s syntax (how to use it to annotate content). HTML’s syntax is very simple, and generally fast to learn—though using it effectively can require more practice. 3.1 HTML Elements HTML content is normally written in .html files. By using the .html extension, your editor, computer, and browser should automatically understand that this file will contain content marked up in HTML. As mentioned in Chapter 2, most web servers will by default serve a file named index.html, and so that filename is traditionally used for a website’s home page. As with all programming languages, .html files are really just plain text files with a special extension, so can be created in any text editor. However, using a coding editor such as VS Code provides additional helpful features that can speed up your development process. HTML files contain the content of your web page: the text that you want to show on the page. This content is then annotated (marked up) by surrounding it with tags: Basic syntax for an HTML element. The opening/start tag comes before the content and tell the computer “I’m about to give you content with some meaning”, while the closing/end tag comes after the content to tell the computer “I’m done giving content with that meaning.” For example, the &lt;h1&gt; tag represents a top-level heading (equivalent to one # in Markdown), and so the open tag says “here’s the start of the heading” and the closing tag says “that’s the end of the heading”. Tags are written with a less-than symbol &lt;, then the name of the tag (often a single letter), then a greater-than symbol &gt;. An end tag is written just like a start tag, but includes a forward slash / immediately after the less-than symbol—this indicates that the tag is closing the annotation. HTML tag names are not case sensitive, but you should always write them in all lowercase. Line breaks and white space around tags (including indentation) are ignored. Tags may thus be written on their own line, or inline with the content. These two uses of the &lt;p&gt; tag (which marks a paragraph of content) are equivalent: &lt;p> The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout. &lt;/p> &lt;p>The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.&lt;/p> Nevertheless, when writing HTML code, use line breaks and spacing for readability (to make it clear what content is part of what element). Taken together, the tags and the content they contain are called an HTML Element. A website is made of a bunch of these elements. Some Example Elements The HTML standard defines lots of different elements, each of which marks a different meaning for the content. Common elements include: &lt;h1&gt;: a 1st-level heading &lt;h2&gt;: a 2nd-level heading (and so on, down to &lt;h6&gt;) &lt;p&gt;: a paragraph of text &lt;a&gt;: an “anchor”, or a hyperlink &lt;img&gt;: an image &lt;button&gt;: a button &lt;em&gt;: emphasized content. Note that this doesn’t mean italic (which is not semantic), but emphasized (which is semantic). The same as _text_ in Markdown. &lt;strong&gt;: important, strongly stated content. The same as **text** in Markdown &lt;ul&gt;: an unordered list (and &lt;ol&gt; is an ordered list) &lt;li&gt;: a list item (an item in a list) &lt;table&gt;: a data table &lt;form&gt;: a form for the user to fill out &lt;svg&gt;: a Scalable Vector Graphic (a “coded” image) &lt;circle&gt;: a circle (in an &lt;svg&gt; element) &lt;div&gt;: a division (section) of content. Also acts as an empty block element (one followed by a line break) &lt;span&gt;: a span (section) of content. Also acts as an empty inline element (one not followed by a line break) Comments As with every programming language, HTML includes a way to add comments to your code. It does this by using a tag with special syntax: &lt;!-- this is a comment --> &lt;p>this is is not a comment&lt;/p> The contents of the comment tag can span multiple lines, so you can comment multiple lines by surrounding them all with a single &lt;!-- and --&gt;. Because the comment syntax is somewhat awkward to type, most source-code editors will let you comment-out the currently highlighted text by pressing cmd + / (or ctrl + / on Windows). If you’re using a code editor, try placing your cursor on a line and using that keyboard command to comment and un-comment the line. Comments can appear anywhere in the file. Just as in other languages, they are ignored by any program reading the file, but they do remain in the page and are visible when you view the page source. Attributes The start tag of an element may also contain one or more attributes. These are similar to attributes in object-oriented programming: they specify properties, options, or otherwise add additional meaning to an element. Like named parameters in R or HTTP query parameters, attributes are written in the format attributeName=value (no spaces are allowed around the =); values of attributes are almost always strings, and so are written in quotes. Multiple attributes are separated by spaces: &lt;tag attributeA=\"value\" attributeB=\"value\"> content &lt;/tag> For example, a hyperlink anchor (&lt;a&gt;) uses a href (“hypertext reference”) attribute to specify where the content should link to: &lt;a href=\"https://ischool.uw.edu\">iSchool homepage&lt;/a> In a hyperlink, the content of the tag is the displayed text, and the attribute specifies the link’s URL. Contrast this to the same link in Markdown: [iSchool homepage](https://ischool.uw.edu) Similarly, an image (&lt;img&gt;) uses the src (source) attribute to specify what picture it is showing. The alt attribute contains alternate text to use if the browser can’t show images—such as with screen readers (for the visibility impaired) and search engine indexers. &lt;img src=\"baby_picture.jpg\" alt=\"a cute baby\"> Note that because an &lt;img&gt; has no textual content, it is an empty element (see below). There are also a number of global attributes that can be used on any element. For example: Every HTML element can include an id attribute, which is used to give it a unique identifier so that you can refer to it later (e.g., from CSS or JavaScript). id attributes are named like variable names, and must be unique on the page. &lt;h1 id=\"title\">My Web Page&lt;/h1> The id attribute is most commonly used used to create “bookmark hyperlinks”, which are hyperlinks to a particular location on a page (i.e., that cause the page to scroll down). You do this by including the id as the fragment of the URI to link to (e.g., after the # in the URI). &lt;a href=\"index.html#nav\">Link to element on `index.html` with `id=\"nav\"`&lt;/a> &lt;a href=\"#title\">Link to element on current page with `id=\"title\"`&lt;/a> Note that, when specifying an id (i.e., &lt;h1 id=\"title\"&gt;) you do not include the # symbol. However, to link to an element with id title, you include the # symbol before the id (i.e., &lt;a href=\"#title\"&gt;) The lang attribute is used to indicate the language in which the element’s content is written. Programs reading this file might use that to properly index the content, correctly pronounce it via a screen reader, or even translate it into another language: &lt;p lang=\"sp\">No me gusta&lt;/p> Specify the lang attribute for the &lt;html&gt; element (see below) to define the default language of the page; that way you don’t need to mark the language of every element. Always include this attribute. &lt;html lang=\"en\"> Empty Elements A few HTML elements don’t require a closing tag because they can’t contain any content. These tags are often used for inserting media into a web page, such as with the &lt;img&gt; tag. With an &lt;img&gt; tag, you can specify the path to the image file in the src attribute, but the image element itself can’t contain additional text or other content. Since it can’t contain any content, you leave off the end tag entirely: &lt;img src=\"picture.png\" alt=\"description of image for screen readers and indexers\"> Older versions of HTML (and current related languages like XML) required you to include a forward slash / just before the ending greater-than symbol. This “closing” slash indicated that the element was complete and expected no further content: &lt;img src=\"picture.png\" alt=\"description of image for screen readers and indexers\" /> This is no longer required in HTML5, so feel free to omit that forward slash (though some purists, or those working with XML, will still include it). 3.2 Nesting Elements Web pages are made up of multiple (hundreds! thousands!) of HTML elements. Moreover, HTML elements can be nested: that is, the content of an HTML element can contain other HTML tags (and thus other HTML elements): An example of element nesting: the &lt;em&gt; element is nested in the &lt;h1&gt; element’s content. The semantic meaning indicated by an element applies to all its content: thus all the text in the above example is a top-level heading, and the content “(with emphasis)” is emphasized in addition. Because elements can contain elements which can themselves contain elements, an HTML document ends up being structured as a “tree” of elements: An example DOM tree (a tree of HTML elements). In an HTML document, the “root” element of the tree is always an &lt;html&gt; element. Inside this we put a &lt;body&gt; element to contain the document’s “body” (that is, the shown content): &lt;html lang=\"en\"> &lt;body> &lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1> &lt;p>This is &lt;em>conteeeeent&lt;/em>!&lt;/p> &lt;/body> &lt;/html> This model of HTML as a tree of “nodes”—along with an API (programming interface) for manipulating them— is known as the Document Object Model (DOM). See Chapter 12 for details. Caution! HTML elements have to be “closed” correctly, or the semantic meaning may be incorrect! If you forget to close the &lt;h1&gt; tag, then all of the following content will be considered part of the heading! Remember to close your inner tags before you close the outer ones. Validating your HTML can help with this. Block vs. Inline Elements All HTML elements fall into one of two categories: Block elements form a visible “block” on a page—in particular, they will be on a new line from the previous content, and any content after it will also be on a new line. These tend to be structural elements for a page: headings (&lt;h1&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), lists (&lt;ul&gt;), etc. &lt;div>Block element&lt;/div> &lt;div>Block element&lt;/div> Two block elements rendered on a page. A &lt;div&gt; (“division”) is the most basic block element: it represents a block of content but provides no other semantic meaning. Inline elements are contained “in the line” of content. These will not have a line break after them. Inline elements are used to modify the content rather than set it apart, such as giving it emphasis (&lt;em&gt;) or declaring that it to be a hyperlink (&lt;a&gt;). &lt;span>Inline element&lt;/span> &lt;span>Other inline element&lt;/span> Two inline elements rendered on a page. A &lt;span&gt; is the most basic inline element: it represents an inline span of content but provides no other semantic meaning. Inline elements go inside of block elements, and it’s common to put block elements inside of the other block elements (e.g., an &lt;li&gt; inside of a &lt;ul&gt;, or a &lt;p&gt; inside of a &lt;div&gt;). However, it is invalid to to nest a block element inside of an inline element—the content won’t make sense, and probably won’t look right. Some elements have further restrictions on nesting. For example, a &lt;ul&gt; (unordered list) is only allowed to contain &lt;li&gt; elements—anything else is considered invalid markup. Each element has a different default display type (e.g., block or inline, but it is also possible to change how an element is displayed using CSS. See Chapter 7. 3.3 Web Page Structure Now that you understand how to specify HTML elements, you can begin making real web pages! However, there are a few more tags you need to know and include for a valid, modern web page. Doctype Declaration All HTML files start with a document type declaration, commonly referred to as the “Doctype.” This tells the rendering program (e.g., the browser) what format and syntax your document is using. Since you’re writing pages with HTML 5, you can declare it as follows: &lt;!DOCTYPE html> &lt;html lang=\"en\"> ... &lt;/html> &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; isn’t technically an HTML tag (it’s actually XML). While modern browsers will perform a “best guess” as to the Doctype, it is best practice to specify it explicitly. Always include the Doctype at the start of your HTML files! The &lt;head&gt; Section In addition to the &lt;body&gt; element that defines the displayed content, you should also include a &lt;head&gt; element that acts as the document “header” (the &lt;head&gt; is nested inside the &lt;html&gt; at the same level as the &lt;body&gt;). The content of the &lt;head&gt; element is not shown on the web page—instead it provides extra (meta) information about the document being rendered. There are a couple of common elements you should include in the &lt;head&gt;: A &lt;title&gt;, which specifies the “title” of the webpage: &lt;title>My Page Title&lt;/title> Browsers will show the page title in the tab at the top of the browser window, and use that as the default bookmark name if you bookmark the page. But the title is also used by search indexers and screen readers for the blind, since it often provides a strong signal about what is the page’s subject. Thus your title should be informative and reflective of the content. A &lt;meta&gt; tag that specifies the character encoding of the page: &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> The &lt;meta&gt; tag itself represents “metadata” (information about the page’s data), and uses an attribute and value to specify that information. The most important &lt;meta&gt; tag is for the character set, which tells the browser how to convert binary bits from the server into letters. Nearly all editors these days will save files in the UTF-8 character set, which supports the mixing of different scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic, etc) in the same file. You can also use the &lt;meta&gt; tag to include more information about the author, description, and keywords for your page: &lt;meta name=\"author\" content=\"your name\"> &lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"description of your page\"> &lt;meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"list,of,keywords,separate,by,commas\"> Note that the name attribute is used to specify the “variable name” for that piece of metadata, while the content attribute is used to specify the “value” of that metadata. &lt;meta&gt; elements are empty elements and have no content of their own. Again, these are not visible in the browser window (because they are in the &lt;head&gt;!), but will be used by search engines to index your page. At the very least, always include author information for the pages you create! We will discuss additional elements for the &lt;head&gt; section throughout the text, such as using &lt;link&gt; to include CSS and using &lt;script&gt; to include JavaScript. 3.4 Web Page Template Putting this all together produces the following “template” for making a web page: &lt;!DOCTYPE html> &lt;html lang=\"en\"> &lt;head> &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"> &lt;meta name=\"author\" content=\"your name\"> &lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"description of your page\"> &lt;title>My Page Title&lt;/title> &lt;/head> &lt;body> ... Content goes here! ... &lt;/body> &lt;/html> You can use this to start off every web page you ever create from now on! Alternatively, you can use the VS Code shortcut of writing an exclamation point (!) then hitting the tab key in a .html file to create a similar page skeleton.

"],["standards-and-accessibility.html", "Chapter 4 Standards and Accessibility 4.1 Web Standards 4.2 Why Accessibility 4.3 Supporting Accessibility Resources", " Chapter 4 Standards and Accessibility This chapter details considerations and techniques to ensure that your web pages and applications can be used by everyone, regardless of their choice of web browser or their own physical abilities. It will provide detailed information on the following strategies for building accessible pages: Using semantically meaningful HTML tags Providing alternate text for visual features (i.e., images) Describing the role of elements on your page (if it isn’t clear based on the element type) Hiding unnecessary content (i.e., visual flare) from screen readers 4.1 Web Standards As discussed in Chapter 2, the HTML and CSS files you author are delivered to clients upon request. The code within these files is interpreted by the web browser in order to create the visual presentation that the user can see and interact with. A web browser is thus any piece of software capable of rendering these .html and .css files (and sending HTTP requests to fetch them in the first place). And there are many different web browsers in the world: Desktop browser market share July 2017, from netmarketshare.com. See also caniuse.com’s usage table for information on mobile and older browsers. Note that while there may be some clear “winners” in terms of browser popularity, do not dismiss less popular browsers. For example, if 0.34% of users use Internet Explorer 8 (July 2017), that’s roughly 1,300,000 people worldwide. These web browsers are all created by different developers, working for different (often rival!) organizations. How is it that they are all able to read and interpret the same code, and produce the same rendered output? Standards. Web Standards are agreed-upon specifications for how web page source code should be rendered by the browser. Web standards detail both the language syntax (e.g., how to write HTML tags) and the language semantics (e.g., which HTML tags to use), so that it can be understood by any browser that follows (agrees to) that standard. And since as a developer you want your pages to render the same across all browsers, web standards give the requirements for how you should write your code so that your pages render correctly. Modern web standards are created and maintained by a huge group of stakeholders known as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which includes major browser developers such as Google and Mozilla. However, this group has no enforcement powers: and so browsers often deviate from the published standards! A browser may ignore a standard to “help out” developers (e.g., making a “best guess” to render malformed HTML content), or to introduce new features (e.g., a new CSS property that produces some special effect). Some browsers are better at conforming to the accepted standards than others. Internet Explorer—IE 6 in particular—is notorious for not meeting standards and requiring extra effort from developers to make pages work. This is part of what IE has such a bad reputation and gets so much scorn from developers (though Microsoft Edge, the browser in Windows 10, is awesome about being standards compliant). Getting so many people to agree on a standard of communication takes time; thus web standards change relatively slowly: the HTML 4 standard was adopted in 1997, but the HTML 5 standard (that this course teaches) wasn’t finalized until 2014. The CSS 3 standard is broken up into more than 50 different modules that are developed and introduced independently, and so is continuously being adopted piece-wise. When introducing new or experimental CSS properties, browsers historically utilized vendor prefixes in naming the properties. As standards are being decided upon, each browser may treat that property in a slightly different way, thus forcing developers who want to use the “latest and greatest” to provide a different definition or value for each vendor. Prefixes are a naming convention that will cause the property to only be understood and applied by a particular browser; e.g., -webkit-hyphens would use the Webkit version of the hyphens property (for controlling word breaks), while -ms-hyphens would use the IE version. This practice is currently discouraged and being phased out, though prefixes may be required when supporting older browsers. Tools such as Autoprefixer can help automatically manage prefixes. In general, as long as you program webpages that conform to web standards, they will work on all “modern browsers”—though there may still be a few cross-browser compatibility concerns to notice. You should thus test and validate your code against the standards (and so don’t ned to test it on every possible browser!). Luckily, the W3C provides online tools that can help validate code: W3C HTML Validation Service W3C CSS Validation Service W3C Developer Tools for a complete list of validators To use these services, simply enter your web page’s URL (or copy and paste the contents of your .html or .css files), and then run the validation. You will definitely want to fix any errors you get. Warnings should be considered; however, it is possible to get false positives. Be sure and read the warning carefully and consider whether or not it is actually a “bug” in your code! Supporting really old browsers that are not standards compliant is left as an exercise to the reader. Develop for other people’s browsers, not your own! Just because it “works” for you, doesn’t mean it works for anyone else. Test your code against standards and automated systems; don’t just look at the rendered result in a single browser! 4.2 Why Accessibility Consider the following hypothetical webpage user: Tracy is a 19-year-old college student and was born blind. Through high school she did well as she could relying on audio tapes and books and the support of tutors, so she never bothered to really learn Braille. She is interested in English literature and is very fond of short stories; her dream is to become an audiobook author. Tracy uses the Internet to share her writing and to connect with other writers through social networks. She owns a laptops and uses a screen reader called JAWS: a computer program which reads her screen out loud to her in an artificial voice. (Adapted from here) One of the most commonly overlooked limitations on a website’s usability is whether or not it can be used by people with some form of disability. There are many different forms of disabilities or impairments that may affect whether or not a person can access a web page, including: Vision Impairments: About 2% of the population is blind, so use alternate mediums for reading web pages. Farsightedness and other vision problems are also very common (particularly among older adults), requiring larger and clearer text. Additionally, about 4.5% the population is color-blind. Motor Impairments: Arthritis occurs in about 1% of the population, and can restrict people’s ease at using a mouse, keyboard or touch screen. Other impairments such as tremors, motor-neuron conditions, and paralysis may further impact people’s access. Cognitive Impairments: Autism, dyslexia, and language barriers may cause people to be excluded from utilizing your website. If you fail to make your website accessible, you are locking out 2% or more of users, reducing the availability and use of your site. Indeed, even web companies with their capitalist world-view are finally seeing this population as an important but excluded market; for example, Facebook has an entire team devoted to accessibility and supporting users with disabilities. “Accessibility Engineers” have good job prospects. Supporting users with disabilities is not just the morally correct thing to do, it’s also the law. US Courts have ruled that public websites are subject to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), meaning that is a possible and not uncommon occurrence for large organizations to be sued for discrimination if their websites are not accessible. So far, “accessibility” has legally meant complying with the W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (see below), a standard that is not overly arduous to follow if you consider accessibility from the get-go. Finally, designing your website (or any system) with accessibility in mind will not just make it more usable for those with disabilities—it will make it more usable for everyone. This is the principle design Universal Design (a.k.a. universal usability): designing for accessibility—being usable by all people no matter their ability (physical or otherwise)—benefits not just those with some form of limitation or disability, but everyone. The classic real-world example of universal design are curb cuts: the “slopes” built into curbs to accommodate those in wheelchairs. However, these cuts end up making life better for everyone: people with rollerbags, strollers, temporary injuries, small children learning to ride a bicycle, etc. Universal design applies to websites as well: If you support people who can’t see, then you may also support people who can’t see right now (e.g., because of a bad glare on their screen). If you support people with motor impairments, then you may also support people trying to use your website without a mouse (e.g., from a laptop while on a bumpy bus). If you support people with cognitive impairments, then you may also support people who are temporarily impaired (e.g., inebriated or lacking sleep). If you make sure that your web page is well-structured and navigable by those with screen readers, it will ensure that it is navigable by other machines, such as search engine indexers. Or for unusual or future browsers (a virtual reality browser perhaps). Thus supporting accessibility in client-side web development is important both for helping a population that is often overlooked (a form of social justice), as well as for supporting new technologies and systems. This fact is increasingly being acknowledged by companies as key to usability, and thus it is important that you apply it to your own design work. In addition to individual capabilities, people are also reliant on a large amount of existing infrastructure to ensure that they have an internet connection and their requests can reach your web server. The lack of such access is often tied to economic or social inequalities, forming what is called the digital divide. Considering the availability of network access and other infrastructural needs is vitally important when developing information technologies, but is difficult to manage through client-side development (though see Responsive Design for some things you can do). 4.3 Supporting Accessibility In this course, we will primarily aim to support accessibility for users with visual impairments such as those using screen readers. A screen reader is a piece of software that is able to synthesize and “read” content on a computer’s screen out loud through the speakers, so that users are able to navigate and control the computer without needing to see the screen. Screen readers are often combined with keyboard controls, so that users use just the keyboard to control the computer and not the mouse (almost like a command line interface!). There are a number of different screen reader software packages available: Macs have had VoiceOver built into the operating system since 2005, though it has been refined with each new OS version. On Windows, the most popular screen readers are JAWS and NDVA. Windows also has a built-in screen reader called Microsoft Narrator, which with Windows 10 is beginning to reach parity with the 3rd-party offerings. You should try out this software! Follow the above links to learn how to turn on the screen reader for your computer, and then try using it to browse the internet without looking at the screen. This will give you a feel for what it is like using a computer while blind. Screen readers are just software that interpret the HTML of a website in order to allow the user to hear and navigate the content—they are basically non-visual web browsers. As such, supporting screen readers just means implementing your web site so it works with this browser. In particular, this means making sure your page conforms to the Web Accessibility Content Guidelines (WCAG). This is a list of principles and techniques that you should utilize when authoring HTML documents in order to make sure that they are accessible. The guidelines are driven by 4 main principles: Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable. Understandable: Information and the operation of user interfaces must be understandable. Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. More concretely, accessible web pages are those that can be navigated by screen readers (so people can easily get to the information they care about), and have content that can be perceived by screen readers (so is not just presented visually). Don’t worry: there are simple, specific implementation steps you can use to follow these principles, the most common of which are described below. Semantic HTML A major step in making sure your web pages are accessible is to make sure that your use of HTML elements is semantic. HTML elements should be used to describe the meaning or form of their content, not to give that content a visual appearance! For example, an &lt;h1&gt; element is used to indicate a top-level heading, such as the title of the page. But by default, browsers will give &lt;h1&gt; elements a different visual appearance than unmarked content (usually by making it larger and bold). It is possible to achieve a similar visual effect just using CSS: &lt;!-- html --> &lt;h1>This is a real heading!&lt;/h1> &lt;div class=\"fake-header\"> This just LOOKS like a heading. &lt;/div> /* css */ .fake-header { font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; } A real heading and a fake heading Your HTML should always be semantic! A screen reader will (mostly) ignore the CSS, so if something is supposed to be a top-level heading, you need to tag it as such for the screen reader to understand that. Similarly, you should only use elements when they are semantically appropriate—don’t use an &lt;h3&gt; element just because you want text to look bigger if it isn’t actually a third-level heading (use CSS to do the styling instead). HTML is just for semantics. CSS is for appearance. This is the same reason that you should never use the &lt;i&gt; tag to make elements italic. The &lt;i&gt; tag has no valuable semantic meaning (it just means “italic”, or “different”); instead you want to use a more meaningful semantic tag. Usually this means &lt;em&gt;, since italic text is usually being emphasized. In fact, HTML 5 includes a large number of semantic elements that can be used to indicate “formatted” text that has a particular meaning, including ones such as: &lt;abbr&gt;, &lt;address&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, &lt;dfn&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, and &lt;time&gt;. Be sure and check the documentation for each of these elements to determine when they are supposed to be used (as well as what additional attributes they may support). Never use the &lt;table&gt; tag to structure documents and position content. The &lt;table&gt; tag should only be used for content that is semantically a table (e.g., a data table). If you want to lay out content in a grid, use a CSS system such as Flexbox (see Chapter 7). ARIA The WCAG is developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), who also have authored an additional web standard for supporting accessibility. This standard is called the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, or ARIA. ARIA specifies an extension to HTML, defining additional HTML attributes that can be included in elements in order to provide additional support for screen readers. For example, ARIA provides additional support to help screen readers navigate through a page (for people who can’t just visually scroll), as well as providing a mechanism by which “rich” interactive web apps (such as those you will create with JavaScript) can communicate their behavior to screen readers. In short, where the HTML standard falls short in supporting accessibility, ARIA steps in. For example, the ARIA specification defines a role attribute that allows non-semantic elements (such as &lt;div&gt; elements) to specify their semantic purpose. For example: &lt;div class=\"btn\" role=\"button\">Submit&lt;/div> would define a unsemantic div element that is styled (via a developer-defined CSS class) to look like a button. But in order to tell the screen reader that this element can be clicked like a button, it is given the role of \"button\". There are a large number of different roles (following a potentially complex classification scheme), and include roles for interactive widgets such as a popup dialog, a progressbar, or a menu. These are important when making complex interactions, though for most simpler pages you can stick with the standard semantic elements (that is: use a &lt;button&gt; instead of a custom &lt;div&gt;). The other important type of ARIA role are landmark roles. These are roles that are used to indicate specific locations in the document, to allow the screen reader to easily “jump” to different sections of the content (thus making the page navigable). Landmark roles include: banner: the “banner” at the top of the page—that is, content related to the website rather than to the specific page itself. Alternatively, use the &lt;header&gt; element described below (in which case you don’t need to include the role=\"banner\" attribute, as it is implied). navigation: a section of links for moving around the page, such as a navigation bar. This allows screen readers to quickly jump to the “quick links” and move around the page as quickly as possible. Note though that listening to all of the links read can be time consuming, so allowing the user to jump to the rest of the content is also important. Alternatively, use the &lt;nav&gt; element described below. main: the start of the “main” content (usually after the banner). This is useful for allowing the screen reader to jump to the meat of the page, past the banner and navigation sections. Alternatively, use the &lt;main&gt; element described below. contentinfo: a section that contains information about the webpage, such as author contact info and copyright information. This is usually found at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, use the &lt;footer&gt; element described below. Considering your content in terms of these roles is a good design trick for figuring out how to organize your page. Page Structure (Navigable) Because screen readers cannot take in a web page’s content “at a glance”, accessible pages need to be explicitly structured so that their content can be easily navigated—e.g., so that the user can quickly “scroll” to a particular blog post. The most important way to provide this structure is by the considered use of heading elements (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc). Screen readers automatically generate a “table of contents” based on these headings, allowing users to easily move through large amounts of content. In order to ensure that the headings are useful, they need to be meaningful (actually marking section headings) and hierarchical (they don’t skip levels: every &lt;h3&gt; has an &lt;h2&gt; above it). The former is just good HTML usage that you will be doing anyway; the later may take some consideration. The &lt;h#&gt; heading elements are part of the original HTML specification, and so will be supported by all screen reader systems. However, HTML 5 introduced additional elements that can be used to help organize web page content in order to make its structure more explicit. These are often referred to as semantic elements or “sectioning elements”. These are all block-level elements that produce no visual effects on their own, but provide semantic structuring to web content. You can think of them as specialized &lt;div&gt; elements. One metaphor is that nesting HTML elements into a &lt;div&gt; is like putting that content into a envelope to “group” it together (e.g., for styling purposes). In that case, a semantic element such as &lt;header&gt; is just an envelope with a unique color that makes it easier to find in the filing cabinet. &lt;header&gt; represents the “header” or introduction part of the page, such as the title or banner image. It may also include common page elements such as navigation or search bars. This corresponds to the role=\"banner\" landmark role; you do not need to include that role if you use this element. Note that a &lt;header&gt; is different from a heading (&lt;h1&gt;) which is different from the &lt;head&gt;! A heading is element (e.g., &lt;h1&gt;) that includes a title or subtitle. A &lt;header&gt; is a “grouping” element that can contain multiple elements, and usually has banner/logo information. The &lt;head&gt; is an element that is NOT part of the &lt;body&gt; (so is not shown in the web page), and contains metadata about that page. &lt;nav&gt; contains navigation links, usually for navigating around the site (think like a navigation bar). Not all links need to be in a &lt;nav&gt;; this is for “sections” of the webpage that are purely navigational. This element corresponds to the role=\"navigation\" landmark role. &lt;main&gt; represents the “main” content of the document. This usually comes after the &lt;header&gt; (but not inside—in fact, &lt;main&gt; cannot be a descendant of &lt;header&gt;). Note that a web page can only have a single &lt;main&gt; element. This element corresponds to the role=\"main\" landmark role. &lt;footer&gt; represents the “footer” of the page, usually containing information about the page. This element corresponds to the role=\"contentinfo\" landmark role. &lt;section&gt; represents a standalone section of content (e.g., that might have a subheading such as &lt;h3&gt;). A &lt;section&gt; can also contain its own &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt; elements relevant to that section. Similarly, an &lt;article&gt; element also represents standalone content, but content that might be published independently (such as a news article or a blog post). Note that a &lt;section&gt; may group together multiple &lt;article&gt; elements (such as a blog roll), and an &lt;article&gt; might potentially contain more than one &lt;section&gt;. Think about how a newspaper is structured (with a “Sports Section” that contains articles, which may themselves have different sections). A typical web page body may thus have a structure similar to: &lt;!-- Starting from the body tag --> &lt;body> &lt;!-- Page header --> &lt;header> &lt;nav> navigation links in here &lt;/nav> &lt;/header> &lt;!-- Main page content --> &lt;main> &lt;section> content... &lt;/section> &lt;section> content... &lt;/section> &lt;/main> &lt;!-- Page footer --> &lt;footer> copyright information here &lt;/footer> &lt;/body> Overall, utilizing these semantic sectioning elements will help organize your content for screen readers (so visually impaired users can easily navigate the page), as well as making your content more clearly structured. Visual Information (Perceivable) Webpages often contain a significant amount of primarily visual information. In addition to obvious media such as images or video, interactive elements may be labeled visually (e.g., a search button that with a magnifying glass icon). In order to make web pages accessible, screen readers need a way to perceive and correctly interpret such content. The most common form of visual information are images (created with the &lt;img&gt; element). In order to make images accessible, you should always include an alt attribute that gives alternate text for when the images cannot be displayed (e.g., on screen readers, but also if the image fails to load): &lt;img src=\"baby_picture.jpg\" alt=\"a cute baby\"> This will be read by screen readers as “a cute baby, image”. Note that the “alt-text” should not include introductory text such as “a picture of”, as screen readers will already report that something is an image! Every image should include an alt attribute! For more complex images (such as charts or infographics), you can instead provide a link to a longer description by using the longdesc attribute. This attribute takes a value that is a URI (relative or absolute; what you would put in the href attribute of a hyperlink) referring to where the description can be found. Screen readers will prompt the user with the option to then navigate to this long description. &lt;img src=\"accessibility_infographic.png\" alt=\"an infographic showing how to make web pages accessible\" longdesc=\"infographic_text.html\"> &lt;!-- link to other page with text description --> Of course, including descriptive text is good for any user, not just the visually impaired! If you wish to add a caption to an image, you can do so accessibly by placing the image inside a &lt;figure&gt; element, and then using a &lt;figcaption&gt; element to semantically designate the caption. &lt;figure> &lt;img src=\"chart.png\" alt=\"a chart showing some information\"> &lt;figcaption> A caption for the above figure. It provides the same information, but in a text format. &lt;/figcaption> &lt;/figure> (The &lt;figure&gt; element is another good example of how multiple HTML elements may be nested and combined to produce complex but accessible page structure!) On the other hand, some images (or other elements) are purely decorative: company logos, icons that accompany text descriptions on buttons, etc. You can cause a screen reader to “skip” these elements by using an ARIA attribute aria-hidden. The element will still appear on the page, it just will be ignored by screen readers. &lt;!-- a search button with an icon --> &lt;!-- the icon img will not be read, but the button text will be --> &lt;button>&lt;img src=\"search_icon.png\" aria-hidden=\"true\">Search&lt;/button> It is also possible to use an ARIA attribute to provide an equivalent to an alt attribute for elements other than &lt;img&gt;, such as a &lt;div&gt; that may be styled in a purely visual way (perhaps with a background image). The aria-label acts like the alt attribute for any element, specifying what text should be read in place of the normal content. &lt;div class=\"green-rect\" aria-label=\"a giant green rectangle\">&lt;/div> For longer descriptions, use the aria-describedby attribute to include a reference to the id of a different element on the same page that contains the textual description. aria-describedby takes as a value a fragment reference (similar to a bookmark hyperlink) to the element containing the description. &lt;div class=\"green-rect\" aria-describedby=\"#rectDetail\">&lt;/div> &lt;p id=\"rectDetail\">The above rectangle is giant and green.&lt;/p> As with bookmark hyperlinks, notice that the aria-describedby value starts with a #, but the target element’s id does not. Additionally, note that while aria-label attributes replaces its elements content, the aria-describedby attribute will be read after the element’s content (see also here). ARIA provides a number of other attributes that can be used to control screen readers, but these are the most common and useful. Overall, the way to make purely visual information accessible is to not have purely visual information. Always include textual descriptions and captions for images, prefer text labels for buttons, etc. In conclusion, creating accessible content basically means writing proper and semantic HTML (what you would do doing anyway), with the small extra step of making sure that visual content is also labeled and perceivable. By meeting these standards, you will ensure that your website is usable by everyone.

CSS is used to define a set of formatting rules, which the browser applies when it renders your page. Thus CSS can tell the browser to use a particular font for the page text, a certain color for the first paragraph in an article, or a picture for the page’s background. Files of CSS rules (called stylesheets) thus act kind of like Styles or Themes in PowerPoint, but are way more powerful. You can control nearly every aspect of an element’s appearance, including its overall placement on the page. To give you some idea of just how much control you have, check out the examples in the CSS Zen Garden. Every one of those examples uses the exact same HTML content, but they all look completely different because each one uses a different CSS stylesheet. This chapter will explain how to include CSS in your web page and the overall syntax for declaring basic CSS rules. Additional details and options can be found in the following chapters 5.1 Why Two Different Languages? If you are new to web programming, you might be wondering why there are two different languages: HTML for your page content; and CSS for formatting rules. Why not just include the formatting right in with the content? There is an old, tried-and-true principle in programming referred to as “separation of concerns”. Well-designed software keeps separate things separate, so that it’s easy to change one without dealing with the other. And one of the most common forms of separation is to keep the data (content) in a program separate from the presentation (appearance) of that data. By separating content (the HTML) from its appearance (the CSS), you get a number of benefits: The same content can easily be presented in different ways (like in the CSS Zen Garden). In web development, you could allow the user to choose different “themes” for a site, or you could change the formatting for different audiences (e.g., larger text for vision-impaired users, more compact text for mobile users, or different styles for cultures with different aesthetic sensibilities). You can have several HTML pages to all share the same CSS stylesheet, allowing you to change the look of an entire web site by only editing one file. This is an application of the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. You can also dynamically adjust the look of your page by applying new style rules to elements in response to user interaction (clicking, hovering, scrolling, etc.), without changing the content. Users who don’t care about about the visual appearance (e.g., blind users with screen readers, automated web indexers) can more quickly and effectively engage with the content without needing to determine what information is “content” and what is just “aesthetics”. Good programming style in web development thus keeps the semantics (HTML) separate from the appearance (CSS). Your HTML should simply describe the meaning of the content, not what it looks like! For example, while browsers might normally show &lt;em&gt; text as italic, you can use CSS to instead make emphasized text underlined, highlighted, larger, flashing, or with some other appearance. The &lt;em&gt; says nothing about the visual appearance, just that the text is emphatic, and it’s up to the styling to determine how that emphasis should be conveyed visually. 5.2 CSS Rules While it’s possible to write CSS rules directly into HTML, the best practice is to create a separate CSS stylesheet file and connect that to your HTML content. These files are named with the .css extension, and are typically put in a css/ folder in a web page’s project directory, as with the following folder structure: my-project/ |-- css/ |-- style.css |-- index.html (style.css, main.css, and index.css are all common names for the “main” stylesheet). You connect the stylesheet to your HTML by adding a &lt;link&gt; element to your page’s &lt;head&gt; element: &lt;head> &lt;!--... other elements here...--> &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\"> &lt;/head> The &lt;link&gt; element represents a connection to another resource. The tag includes an attribute indicating the relation between the resources (e.g., that the linked file is a stylesheet). The href attribute should be a relative path from the .html file to the .css resource. Note also that a &lt;link&gt; is an empty element so has no closing tag. It is also possible to include CSS code directly in your HTML by embedded it in a &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt;, but this is considered bad practice (keep concerns separated!) and should only be used for quick tests. Overall Syntax A CSS stylesheet lists rules for formatting particular elements in an HTML page. The basic syntax looks like: /* This is pseudocode for a CSS rule */ selector { property: value; property: value; } /* This would be another, second rule */ selector { property: value; } A CSS rule rule starts with a selector, which specifies which elements the rule applies to. The selector is followed by a pair of braces {}, inside of which is a set of formatting properties. Properties are made up of the property name (e.g., color), followed by a colon (:), followed by a value to be assigned to that property (e.g., purple). Each name-value pair must end with a semi-colon (;). If you forget the semi-colon, the browser will likely ignore the property and any subsequent properties—and it does so silently without showing an error in the developer tools! Like most programming languages, CSS ignores new lines and whitespace. However, most developers will use the styling shown above, with the brace on the same line as the selector and indented properties. As a concrete example, the below rule applies to any h1 elements, and makes them appear in the ‘Helvetica’ font as white text on a dark gray background: h1 { font-family: 'Helvetica'; color: white; background-color: #333; /* dark gray */ } Note that CSS comments are written using the same block-comment syntax used in Java (/* a comment */), but cannot be written using inline-comment syntax (//a comment). When you modify a CSS file, you will need to reload the page in your browser to see the changed appearance. If you are using a program such as live-server, this reloading should happen automatically! CSS Properties There are many, many different CSS formatting properties you can use to style HTML elements. All properties are specified using the name:value syntax described above—the key is to determine the name of the property that produces the appearance you want, and then provide a valid value for that property. Pro Tip: modern editors such as VS Code will provide auto-complete suggestions for valid property names and values. Look carefully at those options to discover more! Below is a short list of common styling properties you may change with CSS; more complex properties and their usage is described in the following chapters. font-family: the “font” of the text (e.g., 'Comic Sans'). Font names containing white space must be put in quotes (single or double), and it’s common practice to quote any specific font name as well (e.g., 'Arial'). Note that the value for the font-family property can also be a comma-separated list of fonts, with the browser picking the first item that is available on that computer: /* pick Helvetic Nue if exists, else Helvetica, else Arial, else the default sans-serif font */ font-family: 'Helvetica Nue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: the size of the text (e.g., 12px to be 12 pixels tall). The value must include units (so 12px, not 12). See the next chapter for details on units &amp; sizes. font-weight: boldness (e.g., bold, or a numerical value such as 700). color: text color (e.g., either a named color like red or a hex value like #4b2e83. See the next chapter for details on colors. The background-color property specifies the background color for the element. border: a border for the element (see “Box Model” in Chapter 7). Note that this is a short-hand property which actually sets multiple related properties at once. The value is thus an ordered list of values separated by spaces: /* border-width should be 3px, border-style should be dashed, and border-color should be red */ border: 3px dashed red; Read the documentation for an individual property to determine what options are available! Note that not all properties or values will be effectively or correctly supported by all browsers. Be sure and check the browser compatibility listings! CSS Selectors Selectors are used to “select” which HTML elements the css rule should apply to. As with properties, there are many different kinds of selectors (and see the following chapter), but there are three that are most common: Element Selector The most basic selector, the element selector selects elements by their element (tag) name. For example, the below rule will apply to the all &lt;p&gt; elements, regardless of where they appear on the page: p { color: purple; } You can also use this to apply formatting rules to the entire page by selecting the &lt;body&gt; element. Note that for clarity/speed purposes, we generally do not apply formatting to the &lt;html&gt; element. body { background-color: black; color: white; } Class Selector Sometimes you want a rule to apply to only some elements of a particular type. You will most often do this by using a class selector. This rule will select elements with a class attribute that contains the specified name. For example, if you had HTML: &lt;!-- HTML --> &lt;p class=\"highlighted\">This text is highlighted!&lt;/p> &lt;p>This text is not highlighted&lt;/p> You could color just the correct paragraph by using the class selector: /* CSS */ .highlighted { background-color: yellow; } Class selectors are written with a single dot (.) preceding the name of the class (not the name of the tag!) The . is only used in the CSS rule, not in the HTML class attribute. Class selectors also let you apply a single, consistent styling to multiple different types of elements: &lt;!-- HTML --> &lt;h1 class=\"alert-flashing\">I am a flashing alert!&lt;/h1> &lt;p class=\"alert-flashing\">So am I!&lt;p> CSS class names should start with a letter, and can contain hyphens, underscores, and numbers. Words are usually written in lowercase and separated by hyphens rather than camelCased or snake_cased. Note that HTML elements can contain multiple classes; each class name is separate by a space: &lt;p class=\"alert flashing\">I have TWO classes: \"alert\" and \"flashing\"&lt;/p> &lt;p class=\"alert-flashing\">I have ONE class: \"alert-flashing\"&lt;/p> The class selector will select any element that contains that class in its list. So the first paragraph in the above example would be selected by either .alert OR .flashing. You should always strive to give CSS classes semantic names that describe the purpose of element, rather than just what it looks like. highlighted is a better class name than just yellow, because it tells you what you’re styling (and will remain sensible even if you change the styling later). Overall, seek to make your class names informative, so that your code is easy to understand and modify later. There are also more formal methodologies for naming classes that you may wish to utilize, the most popular of which is BEM (Block, Element, Modifier). Class selectors are often commonly used with &lt;div&gt; (block) and &lt;span&gt; (inline) elements. These HTML elements have no semantic meaning on their own, but can be given appearance meaning through their class attribute. This allows them to “group” content together for styling: &lt;div class=\"cow\"> &lt;p>Moo moo moo.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Moooooooooooooooooooo.&lt;/p> &lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"sheep\"> &lt;p>Baa baa &lt;span class=\"dark\">black&lt;/span> sheep, have you any wool?&lt;/p> &lt;/div> Id Selector It is also possible to select HTML elements by their id attribute by using an id selector. Every HTML element can have an id attribute, but unlike the class attribute the value of the id must be unique within the page. That is, no two elements can have the same value for their id attributes. Id selectors start with a # sign, followed by the value of the id: &lt;div id=\"sidebar\"> This div contains the sidebar for the page &lt;/div> /* Style the one element with id=\"sidebar\" */ #sidebar { background-color: lightgray; } The id attribute is more specific (it’s always just one element!) but less flexible than the class attribute, and makes it harder to “reuse” your styling across multiple elements or multiple pages. Thus you should almost always use a class selector instead of an id selector, unless you are referring to a single, specific element. 5.3 The Cascade CSS is called Cascading Style Sheets because multiple rules can apply to the same element (in a “cascade” of style!) CSS rules are additive—if multiple rules apply to the same element, the browser will combine all of the style properties when rendering the content: /* CSS */ p { /* applies to all paragraphs */ font-family: 'Helvetica' } .alert { /* applies to all elements with class=\"alert\" */ font-size: larger; } .success { /* applies to all elements with class=\"success\" */ color: #28a745; /* a pleasant green */ } &lt;!-- HTML --> &lt;p class=\"alert success\"> This paragraph will be in Helvetica font, a larger font-size, and green color, because all 3 of the above rules apply to it. &lt;/p> CSS styling applies to all of the content in an element. And since that content can contain other elements that may have their own style rules, rules may also in effect be inherited: &lt;div class=\"content\"> &lt;!-- has own styling --> &lt;div class=\"sub-sec\"> &lt;!-- has own styling + .content styling --> &lt;ol class=\"demo-list\"> &lt;!-- own styling (ol AND .demo-list rules) + .sub-sec + .content --> &lt;!-- li styling + .demo-list + .sub-sec + .content --> &lt;li>Item 1&lt;/li> &lt;li>Item 2&lt;/li> &lt;li>Item 3&lt;/li> &lt;/ol> &lt;/div> &lt;/div> We call these inherited properties, because the child elements inherit the setting from their ancestor elements. This is a powerful mechanism that allows you to specify properties only once for a given branch of the DOM element tree. In general, try to set these properties on the highest-level element you can, and let the child elements inherit the setting from their ancestor. Rule Specificity Important! Rules are applied in the order they are defined in the CSS file. If you link multiple CSS files from the same HTML page, the files are processed in order as they are linked in the HTML. In processing a CSS file, the browser selects elements that match the rule and applies the rule’s property. If a later rule selects the same element and applies a different value to that property, the previous value is overridden. So in general, all things being equal, the last rule on the page wins. /* Two rules, both alike in specificity */ p { color: red; } p { color: blue; } &lt;p>This text will be blue, because that rule comes last!&lt;/p> However, there are some exceptions when CSS treats rules as not equal and favors earlier rules over later ones. This is called Selector Specificity. In general, more specific selectors (#id) take precedence over less specific ones (.class, which is more specific than tag). If you notice that one of your style rules is not being applied, despite your syntax being correct, check your browser’s developer tools to see if your rule is being overridden by a more specific rule in an earlier stylesheet. Then adjust your selector so that it has the same or greater specificity: /* css */ .alert { color: red; } div { color: blue; } &lt;!-- html --> &lt;div class=\"alert\">This text will be red, even though the `div` selector is last, because the `.alert` selector has higher specificity so is not overridden.&lt;/div> Precedence rules are not a reason to prefer #id selectors over .class selectors! Instead, you can utilize the compound selectors described in Chapter 6 to be able to create reusable rules and avoid duplicating property declarations.

W3C CSS Validation Service "],["css-options.html", "Chapter 6 CSS Options 6.1 Compound Selectors 6.2 Property Values Resources", " Chapter 6 CSS Options Chapter 5 explained the basic syntax and usage of CSS, enough to let you create and style your own web pages. This chapter provides more details about additional selectors and properties to use when defining CSS rules; the following chapter discusses particular properties that can be used to further style the layout of your page’s content. 6.1 Compound Selectors As described in the previous chapter, the core selectors used in CSS are the element selector, class selector, and id selector. However, CSS does offer ways to combine these selectors in order to specify rules only for particular elements or groups of elements. Group Selector The group selector allows you to have a single rule apply to elements matched by lots of different selectors. To do this, separate each selector with a comma (,); the properties defined in the rule will then apply to any element that is matched by any of the selectors. For example, if you want to have a single style for all headings, you might use: /* applies to h1, h2, AND h3 tags */ h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Helvetica; color: #4b2e83; /* UW purple */ } The comma-separated selectors can by any kind of selector, including .class or #id selectors (or any of the combound selectors described below): /* can also include class or id selectors */ /* this rule applies to h2 elements, \"menu\" classed elements, and the #sidebar element */ h2, .menu, #sidebar { background-color: gray; } Note that since later rules take precedence earlier ones, you can use a group select to apply a property to multiple different elements, then include additional rules to add variations. For example, you can have one rule that applies “general” styling to a large class of elements, with further rules then customizing particular elements. /* all headings are Helvetica, bold, and purple */ h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: bold; color: #4b2e83; /* UW purple */ } /* h2 elements are not bolded, but italic */ h2 { font-weight: normal; /* not bold, overrides previous rule */ font-style: italic; } Combined Selectors It is also possible to combine element, class, and id selectors together to be more specific about where a rule applies. You do this by simply putting the class or id selector immediately after the previous selector, without a comma or space or anything between them: /* Selects only p elements that have class=\"alert\" Other p elements and \"alert\" classed elements not affected */ p.alert { color: red; } /* Selects only h1 elements that have id=\"title\" */ /* Note that this is redundant, since only one element can have the id! */ h1#title { color: purple; } /* Selects elements that have class \"alert\" AND class \"success\" */ .alert.success { color: green; font-size: larger; } /* And can combine with group selector */ /* applies to &lt;p class=\"highlighted\"> and &lt;li class=\"selected\"> */ p.highlighted, li.marked { background-color: yellow; } This specificity can allow you to reuse class names (e.g., for shared semantics and readability purposes) but have them work differently for different elements. So a “highlighted” paragraph p.highlighted might look different than a “highlighted” heading h1.highlighted. Note that putting a space between the selectors parts instead specifies a descendant selector, which has a totally separate meaning. Every character matters! Descendant Selector So far, all selectors mentioned will apply to matching elements regardless of where they are in the HTML element tree. But sometimes you want to be more specific and style only a set of elements that exist within a particular parent or ancestor element, and not all the other matching elements elsewhere in the page. You can do this form of targeted selecting using a descendant selector. This is written by putting a blank space ( ) between selectors. Elements are only selected if they have parents that match the selectors that precede them: &lt;header> &lt;h1>Welcome to the page&lt;/h1> &lt;p>I am a special paragraph&lt;/p> &lt;/header> &lt;section> &lt;p>some other paragraph&lt;/p> &lt;/section> /* Selects p elements that exist within header elements Other p elements will not be affected */ header p { /* ... */ } You can have as many “levels” of a descendant selector as you want, and each level can be made up of any kind of selector. However, it is best to not have more than 2 or 3 levels. If you need to be more specific than that, then perhaps defining a new .class is in order. /* selects elements with class=\"logo\" contained within &lt;p> elements contained within &lt;header> elements */ header p .logo { /* ... */ } Note that descendant selectors will select matching descendant elements anywhere lower in the tree branch, not just direct children, so the .logo elements here could be nested several layers below the &lt;p&gt; element (perhaps inside a &lt;span&gt;). This is usually a good idea because you may introduce new nesting layers to your page as you go along, and don’t want to modify the CSS. But if you really want to select only direct children, you can use a variant known as a child selector, which uses a &gt; symbol to indicate direct descendants only: &lt;body> &lt;p>Body content&lt;/p> &lt;section> &lt;p>Section content&lt;/p> &lt;/section> &lt;/body> /* Selects paragraph \"Body content\" (immediate child of body), not paragraph \"Section content\" (immediate child of section) */ body > p { color: blue; } Pseudo-classes The last kind of selector you will commonly use in web development is the application of what are called pseudo-classes. These select elements based on what state the element is in: for example, whether a link has been visited, or whether the mouse is hovering over some content. You can almost think of these as pre-defined classes built into the browser, that are added and removed as you interact with the page. Pseudo-classes are written by placing a colon (:) and the name of the pseudo-class immediately after a basic selector like an element selector. You’ll see this most commonly with styling hyperlinks: /* style for unvisited links */ a:link { /*...*/ } /* style for visited links */ a:visited { /*...*/ } /* style for links the user is hovering over with the mouse */ a:hover { /*...*/ } /* style for links that have keyboard focus */ a:focus { /*...*/ } /* style for links as they are being 'activated' (clicked) */ a:active { /*...*/ } Remember to always set both hover and focus, to support accessibility for people who cannot use a mouse. Additionally, a:hover must come after a:link and a:visited, and a:active must come after a:hover for these states to work correctly. Note that there are many additional pseudo-classes, including ones that consider specific element attributes (e.g., if a checkbox is :checked) or where an element is located within its parent (e.g., if it is the :first or :last-child, which can be useful for styling lists). nth-* Selectors Two powerful pseudo-class selectors are the nth-child and nth-of-type selectors. These selectors allow you to select specific elements based on their position in the DOM. For example, you may want the third &lt;li&gt; element in a (each) list to have a certain style. To do that, you can use the either the nth-child or nth-of-type selector (there’a great description of the difference between these here): /* Get third li element */ li:nth-of-type(3) { color:red; } The nth-* selectors also support the keywords odd and even, which is really useful for styling tables: /* Give every-other row a light-gray background */ tr:nth-of-type(even) { background-color:#eee; } Attribute Selectors Finally, it is also possible to select element that have a particular attribute by using an attribute selector. Attribute selectors are written by placing brackets [] after a basic selector; inside the brackets you list the attribute and value you want to select for using attribute=value syntax: /* select all p elements whose \"lang=sp\" */ p[lang=\"sp\"] { color: red; background-color: orange; } It is also possible to select attributes that only “partially” match a particular value; see the documentation for details. Note that it is most common to use this selector when styling form inputs; for example, to make checked boxes appear different than unchecked boxes: /* select &lt;input type=\"checkbox\"> that have the \"checked\" state */ input[type=checkbox]:checked { color: green; } 6.2 Property Values This section of the guide provides further details about the possible values that may be assigned to properties in CSS rules. These specifics are often relevant for multiple different properties. Units &amp; Sizes Many CSS properties affect the size of things on the screen, whether this is the height of the text (the font-size) or the width of a box (the width; see the next chapter). In CSS, you can use a variety of different units to specify sizes. CSS uses the following absolute units, which are the same no matter where they are used on the page (though they are dependent on the OS and display). Unit Meaning px pixels (\\(\\frac{1}{96}\\) of an inch, even on high-dpi “retina” displays) in inches (OS and display dependent, but maps to physical pixels in some way) cm, mm centimeters or millimeters, respectively pt points (defined as \\(\\frac{1}{72}\\) of an inch) Although technically based on in as a standard, it is considered best practice to always use px for values with absolute units. CSS also uses the following relative units, which will produce sizes based on (relative to) the size of other elements: Unit Meaning em Relative to the current element’s font-size. Although originally a typographic measurement, this unit will not change based on font-family. % Relative to the parent element’s font-size or dimension. For font-size, use em instead (e.g., 1.5em is 150% the parent font-size). rem Relative to the root element’s font-size (i.e., the font-size of the root html or body element). This will often be more consistent than em. vw, vh Relative to the viewport (e.g., the browser window). Represents 1% of the viewport width and height, respectively. This unit is not supported by older browsers. Note that most browsers have a default font size of 16px, so 1em and 1rem will both be initially equivalent to 16px. In general, you should specify font sizes using relative units (e.g., em)—this will support accessibility, as vision-impaired users will be able to increase the default font-size of the browser and all your text will adjust appropriately. Absolute units are best for things that do not scale across devices (e.g., image sizes, or the maximum width of content). However, using relative sizes will allow those components to scale with the rest of the page. Font-sizes should always be relative; layout dimensions may be absolute (but relative units are best). Colors Colors of CSS properties can be specified in a few different ways. You can use one of a list of 140 predefined color names: p { color: mediumpurple; } While this does not offer a lot of flexibility, they can act as useful placeholders and starting points for design. The list of CSS color names also has a fascinating history. Alternatively, you can specify a color as a “red-green-blue” (RGB) value. This is a way of representing additive color, or the color that results when the specified amount of red, green, and blue light are aimed at a white background. RGB values are the most common way of specifying color in computer programs. p { color: rgb(147, 112, 219); /* medium purple */ } This value option is actually a function that takes a couple of parameters representing the amount of red, green, and blue respectively. Each parameter ranges from 0 (none of that color) to 255 (that color at full). Thus rgb(255,0,0) is pure bright red, rgb(255,0,255) is full red and blue but no green (creating magenta), rgb(0,0,0) is black and rgb(255,255,255) is white. Note that if you want to make the color somewhat transparent, you can also specify an alpha value using the rgba() function. This function takes a 4th parameter, which is a decimal value from 0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque): p { background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); /* semi-transparent black */ } CSS also supports hsl() and hsla() functions for specifying color in terms of a hue, saturation, lightness color model. Finally, and most commonly, you can specify the RGB value as a hexadecimal (base-16) number. p { color: #9370db; /* medium purple */ } In this format, the color starts with a #, the first two characters represent the red (ranging from 00 to FF, which is hex for 255), the second two characters represent the green, and the third two the blue: How to reading a hex value, from Smashing Magazine. This is a more compact and efficient way to describe the RGB of a color, and is how most digital artists convey color. See this article for more details about encoding colors. Fonts and Icons As mentioned in the previous chapter, you specify the typographical “font” for text using the font-family property. This property takes a comma-separated list of fonts to use; the browser will render the text using the first font in the list that is available (you can think of the rest as “back-ups”). p { font-family: 'Helvetica Nue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif; } The last font in the list should always be a generic family name. These are a list of “categories” that the browser can draw upon even if the computer doesn’t have any common fonts available. In pracice, the most common generic families used are serif (fonts with serifs, e.g., “Times”), sans-serif (fonts without serifs, e.g., “Arial”), and monospace (fonts with equal width characters, e.g., “Courier”). Serif vs. Sans-Serif fonts. From 99designs.ca. It is also possible to include specific fonts in your web page, which will be delivered to the browser by the web server in case the client doesn’t have the previously available. You do this manually by using the @font-face rule, and specifying the url for the font file (usually in .woff2 format). However, it is usually easier to instead include a stylesheet that already has this rule in place. For example, the Google Fonts collection provides more than 800 different freely available fonts that you can include directly in your web page: &lt;head> &lt;!-- ... --> &lt;!-- load stylesheet with font first so it is available --> &lt;link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Encode+Sans\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> &lt;!-- load stylesheet next --> &lt;link href=\"css/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> &lt;/head> body { font-family: 'Encode Sans', sans-serif; /* can now use Encode Sans */ } Notice that the &lt;link&gt; reference can be to an external file on a different domain! This is common practice when utilizing fonts and CSS frameworks. Important Note that when using Google Fonts, you’ll need to specify if you also want variations such as bold or italic typesets. For example, the Encode Sans font is available in font weights (what you would set with font-weight) from 100 to 900, but you need to specify these in the linked resource: &lt;!-- includes normal (400) and bold (700) weights --> &lt;link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Encode+Sans:400,700\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> If you don’t include the different set of glyphs for the bolded font, then setting the text in that font to bold won’t have any effect (because the browser doesn’t now how to show text in “Bold Encode Sans”)! You can also use external font styles to easily add icons (symbols) to your web page by using an dingbat (icon) font. These are similar in concept to the infamous Wingdings font: they are fonts where instead of the letter “A” looking like two bent lines with a bar between, it instead looks like a heart or a face or some other symbol. By including such a font, you get access to a large number of symbols that can easily be styled (read: colored and sized) to suit your needs. Emoji are defined using a different set of Unicode values, and are browser and operating-system dependent instead of being available through a font. The most popular icon set is called Font Awesome. You can include the Font Awesome font by linking to it as any other stylesheet: &lt;link href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> This will load the stylesheet from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), which is a web service intended to quickly serve files commonly used by multiple websites. In particular, browsers will cache (save) copies of these files locally, so that when you visit a different website (or the same website for a second time), the file will already be downloaded. We will load most of the CSS and JavaScript frameworks used in this class from a CDN. The .min before the .css extension in the filename is a convention to indicate that the file is minimized: all extraneous spaces, comments, etc. have been removed to make the file as small and quick to download as possible. Font Awesome icons can then be included in your HTML by including an element with an appropriate CSS class (that sets the style of that content to be the correct font with the correct “character” content). For example, you can include a Universal Access icon with &lt;i class=\"fa fa-universal-access\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&lt;/i> Because the icon has no semantic meaning beyond an appearance, it is often included with a semantically-deficient (empty) &lt;i&gt; element. Remember to include an aria-hidden attribute so that a screen-reader won’t try to read the strange letter! Other icon-based fonts include Gylphicons and Octicons. Backgrounds and Images You have previously seen how to use the the background-color property to color the background of a particular element. However, CSS supports a much wider list of background-related properties. For example, the background-image property will allow you to set an image as the background of an element: header { background-image: url('../img/page-banner.png'); } This property takes as a value a url() data type, which is written like a function whose parameter is a string with the URI of the resource to load. These URIs can be absolute (e.g., http://...), or relative to the location of the stylesheet (not to the web page!—you may need to use .. if your .css file is inside a css/ directory. There are additional properties used to customize background images, including where it should positioned in the element (e.g., centered), how large the image should be, whether it should repeat, whether it should scroll with the page, etc. header { background-image: url('../img/page-banner.png'); background-position: center top; /* align to center top */ background-size: cover; /* stretch so element is filled; preserves ratio (img may be cropped) */ background-repeat: no-repeat; /* don't repeat */ background-attachment: fixed; /* stay still when window scrolls */ background-color: beige; /* can still have this for anything the image doesn't cover (or for transparent images) */ } This is a lot of properties! To understand all the options for their values, read through the documentation and examples (also here and here). To try and make things easer, CSS also includes a shorthand property called just background. Shorthand properties allow you to specify multiple properties at once, in order to keep your code more compact (if somewhat less readable). Shorthand properties values are written as a space-separated list of values; for example, the above is equivalent to: header { background: url('../img/page-banner.png') top center / cover no-repeat fixed beige; } The background-position and background-size are separated by a / since they both can have more than one value. You can include some or all of the available background properties in the shorthand. Unlike most shorthand properties, the background properties can go in any order (though the above is recommended). Note that a shorthand property is interpreted as writing out all of the rules it replaces; so will replace any previous properties within the same rule: body { background-color: gold; background: mediumpurple; /* later property override previous ones */ /* page will have a purple background */ } Additionally, all of the background properties support multiple backgrounds by using a comma-separated list of values. This can enable you to easily overlay partially-transparent images on top of each other, similar to using layers in Photoshop. There are many, many other properties you can use as well to style your page. Be sure and look through all the documentation and examples, and explore the source code of existing pages to see how they achieved particular effects!

This chapter details how to use CSS to declare where HTML elements should appear on a web page! Placing elements exactly how you want them can be surprisingly difficult. Elements are arranged from the top left corner of the page, and are arranged based on three related (but distinct) concepts: Display: determines how elements share horizontal space Position: allows you to adjust the location of the natural flow of elements Box-model: describes the amount of 2D space taken up by an element, and how much space is between elements 7.1 Display Without any CSS, html elements follow a default flow on the page based on the order they appear in the HTML. Layout is based on whether the element is a block element or an inline element. As mentioned in Chapter 3, inline elements (e.g., &lt;em&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;) are put next to each other on a single line (left to right, unless you specify a right-to-left language). Block elements (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;div&gt;) are placed on subsequent “lines”, from top to bottom. &lt;div>Block element&lt;/div> &lt;div>Block element&lt;/div> Example of block elements, placed on top of each other. &lt;span>Inline element&lt;/span> &lt;span>Other inline element&lt;/span> Example of inline elements, next to each other (even if the code is on separate lines). However, you can force an element to be either block or inline by declaring the display CSS property: .inlined { display: inline; } &lt;!-- this will produce the same result as using &lt;span> elements --> &lt;div class=\"inlined\">Inline element&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"inlined\">Other inline element&lt;/div> The display property also allows you to remove elements from the page flow entirely: .hidden { /* do not show element at all */ display: none; } There are several other more specific settings, the most useful of which is inline-block. This lets you treat an element as inline (no line break after), but also gives you the ability to specify its width, height, and other properties only adjustable on block elements. This is particularly useful for making things like lists (&lt;ul&gt;) appear “inline”. An example of an element with display:inline-block. 7.2 The Box Model The CSS Box Model is one of the core concepts in CSS, and is one of the central frameworks by which elements are visually laid out on the page. All HTML elements (including text!) include an imaginary box around their content. Elements are laid out with their boxes next to each other (side by side for inline, stacked on top for block). These boxes are normally just large enough to contain the content inside the element, but you can use CSS to alter the size of and spacing between these boxes in order to influence the layout. First off, you can set the width and height of elements explicitly, though be careful when you do this. If your width and height are too small, the element’s content will be clipped by default (a behavior controlled by the overflow property). It’s generally best to set only the width or the height, but not both. You can also specify a min-width or min-height to ensure that the width or height is at least a particular size. Conversely, you can use max-width and max-height to constrain the size of the element. In order to adjust the spacing between boxes, you can manipulate one of 3 properties: A diagram of the box model properties Padding The padding is the space between the content and the border (e.g., the edge of the box). An element’s padding. It is possible to specify the padding of each side of the box individually, or a uniform padding for the entire element: /* specify each side individually */ div { padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 0; /* no units needed on 0 */ } /* specify one value for all sides at once */ div { padding: 1.5em; } /* specify one value for top/bottom (first) and one for left/right (second) */ div { padding: 1em 2em; } Border The border (edge of the box) can be made visible and styled in terms of its width, color, and “style”, listed in that order: .boxed { border: 2px dashed black; /* border on all sides */ } .underlined { border-bottom: 1px solid red; /* border one side */ } .something { /* control border properties separately */ border-top-width: 4px; border-top-color: blue; border-top-style: dotted; border-radius: 4px; /* rounded corners! */ } Margin Finally, the margin specifies the space between this box and other nearby boxes. margin is declared in an equivalent manner to padding. An element’s margins. Note that browsers typically collapse (overlap) the margins of adjacent elements. For example, if you have two paragraphs on top of one another, and you set margin-bottom on the first and margin-top on the second, most browsers will overlap those margins and just use the larger of the two values to determine the spacing. Box-Sizing An element’s padding, border, and margin can be used to put space between element content on the page. However, when you assign an explicit width or height to an element, the dimension you specify does not include the padding or border when calculating the size of the element on the page! That is, if you have an element with the properties .my-box { width: 100px; padding: 10px; /* includes both left and right */ } Then the element will take up 120px on the screen: the width plus the left and right padding. However, when specifying more complex or responsive layouts, it’s often useful to have width represent the entire width of the box, and not need to account for the border and padding separately in calculations. You can do this using the box-sizing property—a value of border-box will indicate that specified size of the box (e.g., the width) should include the size of the padding and border when determining the content area. It’s common to want to apply this property to all of the elements on the page, which you can do with the * selector (like a wildcard from the command line!): * { box-sizing: border-box; /* all elements include border and padding in size */ } This is a common enough change that you may wish to include it in all of your .css files! 7.3 Position Specifying the display style and box properties will adjust the layout of HTML elements, but they are still following the browser’s default flow. The layout rules will still apply, and elements are influenced by the amount of content and the size of the browser (e.g., for when inline elements “wrap”). However, it is possible to position elements outside of the normal flow by specifying the position property. Depending on the position property, you can shift the location of elements using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. There are four values that the position property can be set to: static: By default, elements are positioned statically. This is their natural layout, and elements will not be shifted by the top, bottom, left, or right properties. relative: Allows you to shift the element relative to it’s natural position on the page. This enables you to move the element using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. fixed: The fixed position allows you place an element in a consistent location within a browser window. For example, if you wanted a link to always be 50px from the bottom, you could set the properties: position:fixed; and bottom:50px;. absolute: The absolute position allows you to place an element a specific number of pixels from it’s (first non-static) parent element. This allows you to specify where within a parent element you want an element to be positioned. Note, in order to get position:absolute; to work “as expected”, you’ll need to specify that the parent element is position:relative;. See this post for more information. As an example, giving an element a position:fixed property will specify a “fixed” position of the element relative to the browser window. It will no move no matter where it appears in the HTML or where the browser scrolls. See this Code Pen for an example. In order to specify the location for a fixed element, use the top, left, bottom, and/or right properties to specify distance from the appropriate edge of the browser window: /* make the &lt;nav> element fixed at the top of the browser window */ nav { position: fixed; top: 0; /* 0px from the top */ left: 0; /* 0px from the left */ width: 100%; /* same as parent, useful for spanning the page */ } Floating You can also remove an element from it’s normal position in the flow by making it float. This is commonly done with pictures, but can be done with any element (such as &lt;div&gt;). A floated element is shoved over to one side of the screen, with the rest of the content wrapping around it: .floating-image { float: right; margin: 1em; /* for spacing */ } Content will continue to sit along side a floated element until it “clears” it (gets past it to the next line). You can also force content to “clear” a float by using the clear property. An element with this property cannot have other elements floating to the indicated side: .clear-float { clear: both; /* do not allow floating elements on either side */ } The float property is good for when you simply want some content to sit off to the side. But you should not try to use this property for more complex layouts (e.g., multi-column structures); there are better solutions for that. 7.4 Flexbox The position and float properties allow you to have individual elements break out of the normal page flow. While it is possible to combine these to produce complex effects such as multi-column layouts, this approach is fraught with peril and bugs due to browser inconsistencies. In response, CSS3 has introduced new standards specifically designed for non-linear layouts called Flexbox. The Flexbox layout allows you to efficiently lay out elements inside a container (e.g., columns inside a page) so that the space is flexibly distributed. This provides additional advantages such as ensuring that columns have matching heights. Flexbox is a new standard that is now supported by most modern browsers; it has a buggy implementation in Microsoft IE, but is supported in the standards-compliant Edge. For older browsers, you can instead rely on a grid system from one of the popular CSS Frameworks such as Bootstrap. Despite it’s capabilities, Flexbox still is designed primarily for one-directional flows (e.g., having one row of columns). To handle true grid-like layouts, browsers are adopting another emerging standard called Grid. The Grid framework shares some conceptual similarities to Flexbox (configuring child elements inside of a parent container), but utilizes a different set of properties. Learning one should make it easy to pick up the other. Note that the grid framework is less well supported than even Flexbox (it is not supported by IE, Edge, or common older Android devices), so should be used with caution. To use a Flexbox layout, you need to style two different classes of elements: a container (or parent) element that acts as a holder for the item (or child) elements—the child elements are nested inside of the parent: &lt;div class=\"flex-container\"> &lt;!-- Parent --> &lt;div class=\"flex-item\">Child 1&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"flex-item\">Child 2&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"flex-item\">Child 3&lt;/div> &lt;/div> An example of a simple Flexbox layout. Note that the “outer” parent element has one class (e.g., flex-container, but you can call it whatever you want), and the “inner” child elements share another (e.g., flex-item). Creating an effective Flexbox layout requires you to specify properties for both of these classes. You most often use &lt;div&gt; elements for the parent and child elements (and the child of course can have further content, including more divs, nested within it). In order to use a Flexbox layout, give the parent element the display:flex property. This will cause the contents of that parent element to be layed out according to a “flex flow”: .flex-container { /* my flexbox container class */ display: flex; } A flex flow will lay out items horizontally (even if they are block elements!), though you can adjust this by specifying the parent’s flex-direction property. By default, a flex container will fill its parent element (the whole page if the container is in the &lt;body&gt;), and the child items will be sized based on their content like normal. While it is possible to then use dimensional properties such as width and height to size the children within the horizontal layout, Flexbox provides further options that make it more flexible. Any immediate child of the flexbox container can use additional properties to define how that particular item should be layed out within the container. There are three main properties used by flex items: * { box-sizing: border-box; } /* recommended for item sizing */ .flex-item { flex-grow: 1; /* get 1 share of extra space */ flex-shrink: 0; /* do not shrink if items overflow container */ flex-basis: 33%; /* take up 33% of parent initially */ } flex-grow specifies what “share” or ratio of any extra space in the container the item should take up. That is, if the container is 500px wide, but the items’ only takes up 400px of space, this property determines how much of the remaining 100px is given to the item. The value is a unitless number (e.g., 1 or 2, defaulting to 0), and the amount of remaining space is divided up proportionally among the items with a flex-grow. So an item with flex-grow:2 will get twice as much of the remaining space as an item with flex-grow:1. If there are 4 items and 100px of space remaining, giving each item flex-grow:1 will cause each item to get 25px (100/4) of the extra space. If one of the items has flex-grow:2, then it will get 40px (\\(\\frac{2}{1+1+1+2}=\\frac{2}{5}=40\\%\\)) of the extra space, while the other three will only get 20px. In practice, you can give each item a property flex-grow:1 to have them take up an equal amount of space in the container. flex-shrink works similar to flex-grow, but in reverse. It takes as a value a number (default to 1), which determine what “share” or ratio it should shrink by in order to accommodate any overflow space. If the specified dimensions of the items exceeds the dimensions of the container (e.g., 4 100px items in a 300px container would have 100px of “overflow”), the flex-shrink factor indicates how much size needs to be “taken off” the item. A higher number indicates a greater amount of shrinkage. In practice, you will often leave this property at default (by not specifying it), except when you want to make sure that an item does NOT shrink by giving it flex-shrink:0. flex-basis allows you to specify the “initial” dimensions of a particular item. This is similar in concept to the width property, except that flex-basis is more flexible (e.g., if you change the flex-direction you don’t also have to change from width to height). Note that this value can be an dimensional measurement (absolute units like 100px, or a relative unit like 25%). In practice, using percentages for the flex-basis will let you easily size the columns of your layout. Top: visual example of flex-grow. Bottom: visual example of flex-shrink. Notice how much extra “space” each item has after the text content. There is also a shortcut property flex that allows you to specify all three values at once: give the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis values separated by spaces (the second two being optional if you want to use the default values). Note that if unspecified, the flex-basis property will be set to 0, rather than the auto value it has if unspecified. The Flexbox framework also provides a number of additional properties that you can specify on the container to customize how items of different sizes are organized on the screen: justify-content specifies how the items should be spread out across the container. Note that items that have flex-grow:1 will use up the extra space, making this less relevant. align-items is used to specify “cross-axis” alignment (e.g., the vertical alignment of items for a horizontal row). flex-wrap is used to have items “wrap around” to the next line when they overflow the container instead of shrinking to fit. You can then use the align-content property to specify how these “rows” should be aligned within the container. While it may seem like a lot of options, Flexbox layouts will allow you to easily create layouts (such as multi-column pages) that are otherwise very difficult with the regular box model. Moreover, these layouts will be flexible, and can easily be made responsive for different devices and screen sizes.

"],["responsive-css.html", "Chapter 8 Responsive CSS 8.1 Mobile-First Design 8.2 Media Queries Resources", " Chapter 8 Responsive CSS These days the majority of people accessing any web site you build will be using a device with a small screen, such as a mobile phone. But phones come in a wide range of sizes and resolutions, and many people will still access that same site from a laptop or desktop with a much larger monitor (as well as other capabilities, such as a mouse instead of a touchscreen). Different screens may require different visual appearances: for example, a three-column layout would be hard to read on a mobile phone! This poses and interesting design dilemma: how do you build one site that looks good and works well on both tiny phones and gigantic desktop monitors? The modern solution to this problem is Responsive Web Design, which involves using CSS to specify flexible layouts that will adjust to the size of the display: content can be layed out one column on a small mobile screen, but three columns on a large desktop. Example of a responsive web site on multiple devices, with content and layout changing at each size. From responsivedesign.is. This chapter discusses CSS techniques used to create responsive web sites. These techniques underlie popular CSS frameworks, so it is important to understand them even if you rely on such tools. 8.1 Mobile-First Design Responsive design is often framed as a technique to “make it also work on mobile”. This approach feels easy since websites are usually developed and tested on desktops, and follows from the software principle of graceful degradation (systems should maintain functionality as portions break down, such as the “capability” of having screen real estate). But since websites are more likely to be visited on mobile devices, a better approach is to instead utilize mobile-first design. This is the idea that you should develop a website so it content and purpose is effectively presented on mobile devices (e.g., the most restricted in terms of screen size, capabilities, etc). Only once this base level of functionality is in place should you add features to make it also look good on larger devices such as desktops. This approach is also known as progressive enhancement: provide the core functionality, and then add “extra” features as more capabilities become available. Rather than viewing mobile devices as “losing” features, look at desktops as “gaining” features! This will help you to focus on better supporting more common mobile devices. Remember: working on your personal machine doesn’t ensure that it will work on anyone else’s! A great way to test the responsiveness of your design is to click on the Toggle Device Toolbar icon in your element inspector: toggle device toolbar This will allow you to specify a variety of different screensizes for specific devices of interest (i.e., an iPhone 5s, etc.). Mobile-First Design Principles While there is no magic formula for designing websites to support mobile devices, there are a few general principles you should follow: Layout: On mobile devices, blocks of content should stack on top of each other, rather than sitting side by side in columns—mobile devices want to only scroll on one axis. fixed content should be kept to a minimum, as it reduces the amount of scrollable screen real-estate. As you gain more screen space on desktops, you will want to break content up into columns or otherwise constrain its width so that it doesn’t stretch to ridiculous lengths; this helps with readability. Media: Small screens don’t have enough space to necessitate very large, high-resolution images and video. Moreover, large images have large file sizes, and so will take a long time to download on slow mobile connections (not to mention eating away at limited data plans). Use compressed or lower-resolution images on mobile, and consider using background colors or linear gradient fills instead of background images. You can use higher-resolution media (and more of it!) on desktops, which usually have higher bandwidth available for downloading. Page bloat is a real problem. You don’t need huge images… or possibly any images at all! Fonts: Make sure to use a large enough font that it is readable on small screens… but don’t make headings or callout text too large so that you lose that precious real estate! You can make them more styled and prominent on desktop, where there is room for such flourishes. Be sure to use relative units to accommodate mobile user preferences and screen size variation. Also remember that special web fonts you may be downloading will also take up extra bandwidth! Navigation: Site navigation links take up a lot of room on small screens and may end up wrapping to multiple lines. Use small tab bars, or menu icons (e.g., the “hamburger icon”) to show complex menus on command. Most CSS frameworks provide some kind of collapsible navigation for mobile devices. Input and Interaction: Tap/click targets need to be large-enough on mobile to select using a finger, especially for people with poor eyesight or thick fingers. Tiny icons placed right next to one another, or one-word hyperlinks are difficult to select accurately. Specifying a data type on form fields (e.g., email address, phone number, date, integer) also generates optimized on-screen keyboards, making data entry much easier. Content: For some sites, you may even want to adjust what content is shown to mobile users as opposed to desktop users. For example, a phone number might become a large telephone icon with a tel: hyperlink on mobile phones, but simply appear as a normal telephone number on desktop displays. Specifying Viewport Mobile web browsers will do some work on their own to adjust the web page in response to screen size—primarily by “shrinking” the content to fit. This often produces the effect of the website being “zoomed out” and the user enlarging the web page to a readable size and then scrolling around the page to view the content. While it may “work” it is not an ideal user interaction—this behavior can also interfere with attempts to be explicit about how webpages should adjust to the size of the screen. To fix this, you need to specify the viewport size and scale by including an appropriate &lt;meta&gt; element in your HTML: &lt;head> &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"> &lt;!-- always need this --> &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\"> &lt;!-- more head elements, including &lt;link> ... --> &lt;/head> Including this element will keep the text size from adjusting to the browser’s width (though very narrow browsers may still shrink the text). While not technically part of any web standard, the viewport meta element was introduced by Safari and is supported by most mobile browsers. The content attribute for the above meta tag sets 3 properties for mobile browsers: width (how big the viewport should be, specified to be the size of the device screen), initial-scale (how much to initially “zoom” the page, specified to be 1x or no zoom), and shrink-to-fit (tells Safari 9.0+ not to shrink the content to fit). You should include the viewport meta tag in all of your responsive pages. Make it part of your default HTML template! 8.2 Media Queries In order to define a webpage with a responsive appearance, you need to be able to conditionally change the applied style rules depending on the size of the screen (or browser window). We can conditionally apply CSS rules by using media queries. A media query is a bit like an if statement in CSS: it specifies a condition and the rules (selectors and properties) that should apply when that condition is true. Media queries have syntax similar to the following: /* A normal CSS rule, will apply to all screen sizes */ body { font-size: 14px; } /* A Media Query */ @media (min-width: 768px) { /* these rules apply ONLY on screens 768px and wider */ /* a normal CSS rule */ body { font-size: 18px; background-color: beige; } /* another CSS rule */ .mobile-call-icon { display: none; /* don't show on large displays */ } } A media query is structurally similar to a normal CSS rule. The “selector” is written as @media, indicating that this is a media query not a normal CSS rule. The @media is then followed by a query expression, somewhat similar to the boolean expressions used in if statements. Expressions are written in parentheses, with the media feature to check, followed by a colon (:), followed by the value to check against. There are no relational operators (no &gt; or &lt;) in media queries, so you use media features with names such as min-width and max-width (to represent width &gt; x and width &lt; x respectively). Media feature comparisons are not strict inequalities, so min-width: 1000px can be read as “width greater than or equal to 1000px”. It is also possible to use the logical operators and and not to combine media feature checks. You can produce an “or” operator using a group selector (a comma ,). /* style rules for screens between 768px and 992px */ @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 992px) { } /* style rules for screens larger than 700px OR in landscape orientation */ @media (min-width: 700px), (orientation: landscape) { } The @media rule is followed by a {} block, inside of which are listed further regular CSS rules. These rules will only be applied if the @media rule holds. If the @media rule does not apply, then these “inner” rules will be ignored. These “inner” rules can utilize all the selectors and properties value outside of media queries—think of them as mini “conditional” stylesheets! You need to put full rules (including the selector!) inside of the media query’s body. You can’t just put a property, because the browser won’t know what elements to apply that property to. Media queries follow the same ordering behavior as other CSS rules: the last rule on the page wins. In practice, this means that media queries can be used to specify conditional rules that will override more “general rules”. So in the example above, the page is set to have a font-size of 14px using a rule that will apply on any screens. However, on larger screens, the media query will also apply, overriding that property to instead make the default font size 18px. Following a mobile-first approach, this means that your “normal” CSS should define the styling for a the page on a mobile device. Media queries can then be used to add successive sets of rules that will “replace” the mobile styling with properties specific to larger displays. /* on small mobile devices, the header has a purple background */ header { font-size: 1.2rem; background-color: mediumpurple; } /* on 768px OR LARGER displays */ @media (min-width: 768px) { header { font-size: 1.5rem; /* make the header larger font on larger displays */ } } /* on 992px OR LARGER displays */ @media (min-width: 992px) { header { background-image: url('../img/banner.png') /* use background image */ } } In this example, the &lt;header&gt; is given a simple purple background and default font size. When loaded on mobile devices, this is the only rule that applies (the media queries don’t apply to the given screensize), so that is all the styling that occurs. But on devices 768px or wider (like a tablet), the first media query is activated. This will then run a second rule that applies to the &lt;header&gt;, overriding the font to be larger (1.5rem)—it’s as if we had listed those two header rules one after another, and the later one wins. But the first rule continues to apply, making the background purple. Finally, a device 992px or wider (like a desktop computer), will cause both of the media queries to execute. (since a device whose width is greater than 992px is ALSO greater than 768px). Thus the &lt;header&gt; will be given a purple background and default font size, which will then be overridden to be a larger font by the first media query. The second media query will add an additional property (a banner image background), which will combine with the previous purple background (e.g., if the banner has any transparency). So on large displays, there will be a banner background on top of purple, with text in a larger (1.5rem) font. This structure (starting with “default” mobile rules and then using media queries with increasingly larger min-width values) produces an effective mobile-first approach and clean way of organizing how the appearance will change as the screen gets larger. Note that while you can define as many media queries as you want, most professionals define only a few that match the common breakpoints between phone, tablet, and desktop screen widths. Since the media queries need to come after the mobile rules, they are often included at the end of the stylesheet—give all the mobile rules first, then all the media queries that modify them. (You can and should put multiple rules in each media query). (Alternatively, it’s also reasonable to organize your stylesheets based on page “section”, with the mobile rules for that section given before the media queries for that section. E.g., after all your rules for creating the page header, put the media query with variations for desktop headers. Use whatever organization makes your code readable and maintainable, and leave plenty of comments to guide the reader!) Example: Responsive Flexbox As another example of using media queries to produce a responsive website, consider how they can combine with Flexbox to produce a single-column layout on mobile devices, but a multi-column layout on larger displays. Because a Flexbox layout is just a property applied to existing elements, we can effectively “turn on” the flex layout by using media queries. Consider some simple HTML: &lt;div class=\"row\"> &lt;div class=\"column\">column ONE content&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"column\">column TWO content&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"column\">column THREE content&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"column\">column FOUR content&lt;/div> &lt;/div> By default (without any style rules applied to the .row or .column classes), the four inner &lt;div&gt; elements (as block elements) will stack on top of each other. This is the behavior you want on mobile narrow screens, so now additional CSS or Flexbox usage is needed. In order to turn these divs into columns on larger displays, introduce a media query that applies the flex layout to the .row (which acts as the container), thereby lining up the .column elements (which act as the items) /* on devices 768px OR WIDER */ @media (min-width: 768px) { .row { /* row becomes a flexbox container */ display: flex; } .column { /* column becomes a flexbox item */ flex-grow: 1; /* make the columns grow equally to fill the row */ } } You can also add an additional media query at another breakpoint so that the layout starts out stacked, then switches to two columns on medium-sized displays (leading to a two-by-two grid), and then switches to four columns on large displays: /* on devices 768px OR WIDER */ @media (min-width: 768px) { .row { /* row is a flexbox container */ display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; /* wrap extra items to the next \"line\" */ } .column { /* column is a flexbox item */ flex-basis: 50%; /* columns take up 50% of parent by default */ flex-grow: 1; } } @media (min-width: 1200px) { .column { flex-basis: auto; /* columns are automatically sized based on content */ } } In this case, the first media query (768px + or medium-sized displays) applies the flex layout and specifies that the items should wrap if they overflow the container… which they will, since each item has a default flex-basis size of 50% of the container. This will cause each of the 4 items to take up 50% of the parent, wrapping around to the next line. Then when the screen is larger (1200px + or large-size displays), the second media query is applied and overrides the flex-basis so that it will automatically calculate based on the content size, rather than being 50% of the parent. That way as long as the columns fit within the parent, they will all line up in a row (they have the flex-grow property to make them equally spread out). The best way to get a feel for how this works is to see it in action: see this CodePen for an example of the above behavior—resize the browser and watch the layout change! Media rules are a powerful and declarative way to create a single page that looks great on everything from a small mobile touchscreen to a large desktop monitor with a mouse, and form the foundation for responsive CSS frameworks that can help you easily create fantastic looking pages. Resources Responsive Web Design Basics (Google) Using media queries (MDN) "],["css-frameworks.html", "Chapter 9 CSS Frameworks 9.1 Using a Framework 9.2 Bootstrap Resources", " Chapter 9 CSS Frameworks The previous chapters have covered how to use CSS to make your page both stylish and responsive. While it is certain possible to implement an entire site by creating your own CSS rules, that can quickly get tedious: often you’d like a page to have a “standard” set of rules (because the browser’s style-less appearance) and then customize those rules to your liking. For this reason, most professional web developers utilize an existing CSS Framework instead. A CSS Framework is a stylesheet (a .css file!) that contains a large list of pre-defined rules that you can apply to your page. CSS frameworks provide a number of benefits: Applies attractive default styling to all HTML elements: CSS frameworks make your pages instantly look better through a bunch of element selector rules. Frameworks provide pleasant default fonts, line spacing, spacing, and link styling without any extra effort on your part. Provides style classes for common UI components: framework stylesheets will also include CSS classes you can add to your markup to easily include badges, in-page tabs, drop-down buttons, multi-column layouts, and more. Frameworks enable you to add style your page by specifying CSS classes, rather than needing to define multiple CSS rules for a single effect. CSS frameworks are thus designed to make your life easier and your development more efficient—while still enabling you to provide your own customizations and styling with all of the power of CSS. There are many different CSS frameworks to choose from. Some popular ones include: Bootstrap is the most commonly used CSS framework on the web. Sometimes called “Twitter Bootstrap”, it was originally created at Twitter to enforce some consistency among their internal tools, but was released as an open-source project in 2011. Its popularity has benefits and drawbacks: it’s very well tested, documented, and supported, but it’s also so prevalent that it’s default look has become cliché. The latest release of Bootstrap, v4 was released in 2017. This version includes an update look and feel, and makes it relatively easy to create your own customized version. Bootstrap 4 also uses Flexbox as a foundation for its grid system, offering some better performance. For this and other reasons, Bootstrap 4 does not support IE 9 or earlier browsers. For older browsers, you’d want to use Bootstrap 3. This text discusses Bootstrap 4 as an example. Be careful that you are looking at information about the right version if you seek out documentation or help online! Foundation is Bootstrap’s chief rival, and has a reputation for being more ahead-of-the-curve than Bootstrap (introducing new features sooner). For example, it was the first framework to use a responsive mobile-first design, and provided a Flexbox-based grid long before Bootstrap. Foundation has most of the same UI elements as Bootstrap, but with a different look and feel (that can be customized through a web-based tool). Material Components for the Web (MCW) is an official implementation of Google’s Material Design visual language. This is the look-and-feel found in most Google products and Android applications. Material Design is very opinionated so MCW is very difficult to customize. The MCW style class names are also very verbose, as they follow the Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming scheme. Materialize is the other popular Material Design implementation. This is an open-source project, so it is not provided nor supported by Google. However, it is structurally similar to Bootstrap, making it easy to learn and popular among people who know that framework. normalize.css is not so much a full framework as a small utility that performs browser normalization (also called a “reset”). normalize.css standardizes the quirks across browsers and making it so that the same HTML and CSS is displayed more consistently and without errors. Note that most other frameworks include some version of this package (for example, Bootstrap contains a fork called Reboot). If you choose not to use a framework, you should still include normalize to make your sites consistent! Other frameworks exist as well, each with its own benefits and drawbacks (e.g., Skeleton is designed to be as lightweight as possible, but at the cost of features). 9.1 Using a Framework The important thing to realize is that a CSS framework is just a stylesheet with a bunch of rules that someone else wrote for you. There’s nothing magic about them. You can look at the stylesheet and see all the rules that have been defined, and it’s all stuff you could have written yourself (though some of it can be quite complex). But those rules have been crafted by professionals and tested on a wide array of browsers to ensure consistent results, so it’s a good idea to build on top of them rather than trying to re-invent the wheel. For example, you can view the normalize.css file at https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/7.0.0/normalize.css and see that it looks exactly like the CSS you might write on your own! Including a Framework Because a CSS framework is just a CSS file, you include one in your page using a &lt;link&gt; element just like with any other stylesheet: &lt;head> &lt;!--... other elements here...--> &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/css/bootstrap.css\"> &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/my-style.css\"> &lt;/head> Important! Note that you link the CSS framework before you link your own stylesheet. Remember that CSS is read top-to-bottom, and that the last rule on the page wins. By putting your stylesheet second, any rules you define will override the rules specified in the framework, thereby allowing you to continue to customize the appearance. For example, bootstrap.css gives the &lt;body&gt; a color of #212529 (very dark gray); you may instead want to have a different default text color:: /* my-style.css */ body { color: blue; } If you included your stylesheet first in the &lt;head&gt;, then your rule would be applied initially but would be overridden by the bootstrap.css file, causing your rule to seem to have no effect! Thus you should always put your own custom CSS as the last &lt;link&gt; in the page, after any CSS frameworks. It is most common to include the minified versions of CSS frameworks: these are usually named as .min.css files (e.g., bootstrap.min.css). A minified file is one that has extra comments and white space removed, creating a file with a much smaller size (remember that each space and line break is a character so takes up a byte! Bootstrap goes from 160 kilobytes to about 127 kilobytes when minimized). Because web pages have to be downloaded, smaller pages will be downloaded faster, and thus will be “quicker” for the user. While an unminimized CSS file won’t “break the bank”, the extra white space doesn’t provide anything that you need. You can almost always switch between the minimized and non-minimized file just by changing the file name between file.css and file.min.css (when using a CDN). There are a few different ways of accessing a CSS framework’s stylesheet in order to link it into your page: Linking to a CDN The easiest option is usually to link to a Content Delivery Network (CDN), which is a web service intended to quickly serve files commonly used by multiple websites. To do this, you simply provide the URL for the file on the CDN’s servers as the href of your link (as in the example above). CDNJS is a CDN for packages and libraries operated by Cloudflare, and is a good place to start if you’re unsure of the CDN link for a packages. Other packages may have different CDN hosting (e.g., Bootstrap recommends a link from its own BootstrapCDN). In addition to being simple, CDNs also provide a distinct speed benefit: CDNs replicate their content to machines in several regions of the world, and use dynamic Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution to steer users to the machine nearest them. So a user in Australia might download the Bootstrap CSS from a server located in Singapore, while a user in France might get the same CSS file from a server located in Ireland. This helps increase the speed that the files are downloaded. Additionally, CDNs allow a site to take advantage of browser caching: browsers will save previously downloaded versions of a file to avoid downloading it again. If multiple sites all use the CDN version of Bootstrap, then the browser only has to download that file the first time you visit one of those sites. With popular frameworks like Bootstrap, it’s highly likely that your user has already visited a site that links to Bootstrap’s CDN version, and thus the Bootstrap files are already in the user’s browser cache. Finally, CDNs allow the frameworks to be accessed as a service, meaning that developers may be able to quickly patch bugs (if the fix doesn’t break existing code) without the developer having to do anything. (This feature can also be seen as a drawback, as you need to trust the library developer not to break anything or accidentally include malicious code). The only real disadvantage to linking to a CDN is that it won’t work when you are offline. If you commonly do your development offline, or if you are building a web application that is meant to run offline, you’ll need to utilize a different method. Downloading the Source If you can’t link to a CDN, you’ll need to download the source file directly to your computer and saving it as a source code file in your project (often in a lib/ folder). These files can be found on the framework’s website, or often in their GitHub repo (look for the .css file, or for a dist/ distribution folder). In addition to being available offline, downloading CSS files directly provides a few other advantages: Frameworks may allow you to customize their content even before you include the file: selecting only the components you need, and adjusting base styling properties before downloading your customized source file. If you use a CSS pre-compiler such as SASS, you can often modify the source-code mix-ins to more easily provide your own customizations and override the default fonts, colors, sizes, etc. simply by changing some variables. If you use a build system such as gulp or webpack, then you can often combine all of your CSS files into a single file. This reduces the total number of files that need to be downloaded, which can increase the page load speed—especially on slower mobile networks. Note that it is also possible to utilize a package manager such as npm to download and manage the source for frameworks. This has the advantage of enabling you to avoid adding large extraneous source files to your code repo, as well as managing any dependencies for those libraries. Recall that you can install a package using npm, saving the dependency into your project’s package.json file: # install bootstrap npm install --save bootstrap@4 (This explicitly loads Bootstrap 4. See below for details). This will install the library’s source code into your project’s node_modules/ folder. You will then need to dig around inside that source folder for the .css file you wish to link (it is in no way consistent for all frameworks) &lt;!-- notice the RELATIVE path to the file --> &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\"> Because you’ve saved the dependency in your package.json file, you can use the .gitignore file to exclude the node_modules/ folder from your code repo, having new developers install the required framework via npm install. You can also use npm to easily upgrade the packages (such as when Bootstrap 4 leaves beta). Important: if you are publishing a site to GitHub Pages, you must add the node_modules folders to your code repo so that it will get uploaded to GitHub and the file will be present on the server! For this reason, I recommend just using a CDN when working with GitHub Pages. 9.2 Bootstrap This section discusses some of the features and uses of the Bootstrap CSS framework. Note that many other frameworks are used in a similar fashion (though the specific classes and components may be different). You include the Bootstrap framework by linking its .css file to your page (whether from a CDN or a local file). You can get the link for the latest version from the Bootstrap Home Page. &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-9gVQ4dYFwwWSjIDZnLEWnxCjeSWFphJiwGPXr1jddIhOegiu1FwO5qRGvFXOdJZ4\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> (This &lt;link&gt; example has 2 additional (optional) attributes: integrity gives a cryptographic hash of the source code so the browser can make sure you didn’t download a malicious file by mistake, and crossorigin which says that no credentials are sent to the remote server—see the AJAX chapter for a more detailed discussion). When you first include the Bootstrap framework, you’ll immediately see the effects (usually for the better!): the default font has changed, margins are different, and so forth. The Bootstrap CSS file contains a number of rules that apply to elements without an extra work, including the &lt;body&gt; and headers. See the documentation for details about the default styling (as well as the entire “Content” section of the documentation). Utility Classes In addition to the base styling rules, Bootstrap also includes a huge number of rules that can be applied to elements by giving them a particular CSS class. These utility classes are what gives Bootstrap its power and flexibility. For example, Bootstrap provides text utilities that allow you to style text just by giving it a CSS class, rather than needing to write a new rule for that element. This example shows the text-justify utility, which justifies the text (i.e., the letter- and word-spacing is adjusted so that the text falls flush with both margins): The text-justify utility class will justify a block of text. Example from the Bootstrap documentation. While it would be possible to write such a rule yourself, Bootstrap provides these classes as “built-in”, so you can focus on the semantics of the content rather than the CSS. Many elements need to be given an additional utility class to indicate that they should use Bootstrap styling. For example, in order to give a &lt;button&gt; a Bootstrap style, it needs to have the class btn. This allows you to utilize Bootstrap’s styling, but to not be forced to “override” that look and feel if you want to do something different. &lt;button>Plain button&lt;/button> &lt;button class=\"btn\">Bootstrap button&lt;/button> &lt;button class=\"btn btn-primary\">Primary colored button&lt;/button> Bootstrap Button classes. The last button in this example has an additional utility class btn-primary that specifies which color style it should use. Bootstrap provides a number of pre-defined color styles, named after semantic meaning (e.g., primary or warning): Bootstrap Button colors. These same color classes can be applied to text elements (e.g., text-primary), element backgrounds (e.g., bg-primary), alert blocks (e.g., alert-warning), and more. Modifying the SASS source code for Bootstrap will allow you to easily customize these colors while keeping the theme consistent. Note that you can even use the btn class to style other elements (e.g., &lt;a&gt; links) so that they look like buttons! &lt;a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"#\">A link&lt;/a> “Stacking” utility classes like this is quite common in Bootstrap; it is not unusual for an element to have 4 or 5 different utility classes to fully specify its appearance. Bootstrap is filled with utility classes, both for generic styling (e.g., borders or position), and for specific types of content (e.g., lists, tables, forms). Check out the documentation and examples for details on how to style particular elements and achieve specific effects. Bootstrap also includes utility classes specifically to support screen readers. For example, the sr-only class can be used to style an element so it is only perceivable to screen readers. Utility classes do not mean you never have to write any CSS rules! While Bootstrap provides classes to handle lots of “common” styling, you’ll almost always need to add your own customizations on top of it to produce the appearance you want. Responsive Design A major feature of Bootstrap (and other CSS frameworks) is the ability to support mobile-first, responsive webpages. Many Bootstrap utility classes use media queries to cause them to respond to the device’s screen size. Bootstrap’s responsive utilities utilize a predefined set of responsive breakpoints: screen widths that mark the “boundaries” between different size devices. Screen Width Abbreviation Approximate Device Size &lt; 576px (default) Extra-small devices (portrait phones) ≥ 576px sm Small devices (landscape phones) ≥ 768px md Medium devices (tablets) ≥ 992px lg Large devices (desktops) ≥ 1200px xl Extra-large devices (large desktops) All of these size specifications are “greater than or equal”, following a mobile first approach. Thus a responsive utility that applies to a medium (md) screen will also apply to large (lg) and extra-large (xl) screens. Responsive utilities are named with the size’s abbreviation to specify what screen size that utility should apply on. For example, the float-left class will cause an element to float to the left on any sized screen (it has no size specification). On the other hand, the float-md-left class will cause the element to float only on medium or larger screens. Similarly, the float-lg-left class would cause the element to float only on large or larger screens. This would allow you to have an image that floats to the side on a bigger screen, but is flowed with the rest of the content when there isn’t enough room. The breakpoint abbreviations are consistent across Bootstrap (and even shared by other frameworks such as Materialize), and usually comes after the name of property to change but before the value to give it. For example, the d-none class gives an element a display:none on all devices, while d-sm-none would apply on small or larger screens. Many (but not all!) Bootstrap classes support responsive breakpoints. The most common class to do this is the container class. Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap, and are required for doing more complex layouts (such as Grids, below). The container class gives the element a fixed width that includes some padding on the sides, so that the content isn’t right up against the edge of the window. If the size of the window shrinks to the point where the padding would disappear, the container responsively changes size so that there remains padding even on the smaller screen! See this Code Pen for an example. If you slowly resize the browser, you’ll see the text “jump” to a smaller width as you pass each responsive breakpoint. .container elements are usually direct children of the &lt;body&gt; (e.g., &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;). However, if you want a background color or image to “full bleed” to the edges of the viewport, you can put the .container inside the another element that is styled with the background, as in the CodePen example. Bootstrap also provides an alternate container-fluid class that always has the same amount of padding around the content, with the content “reflowing” based on the browser size. In general, every page you style with Bootstrap will have a Container (usually a .container) to hold the content. The Grid After Containers, most common use of the responsive utility classes in CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap is to provide a grid layout, similar to the multi-column layouts created with Flexbox in the previous chapters. The Bootstrap Grid system allows you to specify these kinds of complex, responsive layouts without needing to implement your own Flexbox containers and items. You specify that a set of elements should be part of a “grid” by putting them inside a .row element (the row class ensures that the elements are lined up). A .row acts a lot like a “flex-container” (and in fact does have display:flex), where each of its children will be “flex items”. Note that the .row must be a direct child of a Container (container or container-fluid); this ensures that grid will be positioned and spaced within its parent correctly. &lt;div class=\"container\"> &lt;!-- container for the grid --> &lt;div class=\"row\"> &lt;!-- a row of items --> &lt;div class=\"col-6\">Item 1&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"col-4\">Item 2&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"col\">Item 3&lt;/div> &lt;/div> &lt;/div> You specify how wide each item in the .row is by specifying the number of “columns” it spans. Think of the grid as containing 12 “slots”: Each item in the grid is given a class that indicates how many of these slots it takes up (similar to merging cells in a spreadsheet): These classes are named in the format col-#, where the # is how many column slots it should take. For example a .col-4 will take up 4 columns, while a .col-6 will take up 6 columns. A class of just col will take up an equal share of the remaining columns (similar to what happens with the flex-grow property!) Thus the above HTML will produce elements with the following layout: Notice that “Item 1” takes up half (6/12) of the grid, “Item 2” takes up a third (4/12), and “Item 3” takes up the remainder (2/12). You can also make this grid layout responsive by using responsive utility versions of the col-# classes. For example, a .col-md-4 would take up 4 columns only on medium or larger screens, while a .col-lg-6 would take up 6 columns only on large or larger screens. Note that a child of the .row that doesn’t have a column size will effectively act as its own row (on its own line). Finally, note that you can specify multiple responsive utilities on each grid item! For example, you can specify that items should take up 6 columns on small or larger screens (col-6-sm), only but 3 columns on medium or larger screens (col-3-sm): &lt;div class=\"container\"> &lt;div class=\"row\"> &lt;div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-3\">Item 1&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-3\">Item 2&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-3\">Item 3&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-3\">Item 4&lt;/div> &lt;/div> &lt;/div> (See a CodePen of this code in action!) The ordering of Bootstrap’s CSS means that the col-sm-6 class will get overridden by the col-md-3 class (since md is a more specific size than sm), so you can specify both classes and the correct one will apply—the order of the class names in the element doesn’t matter. Note that the “or larger” part of the responsive breakpoint definition also means that you don’t need to specify a column width for each different breakpoint, only for the smallest level at which the utility should apply (e.g., we don’t need col-lg- since it isn’t different than col-md-). Bootstrap includes a number of utilities that can be used to customize how grids of content are displayed, including all of the features of Flexbox. For more details and options, see the Grid documentation. Components In addition to its basic and responsive utilities, Bootstrap provides a number of CSS classes that let you easily create more complex components or widgets: alerts, cards, navbars, collapsible boxes, image carousels, pop-up modals, and more. Each of these components is discussed in the documentation, and has its own particular element structure and CSS classes you need to use. For example, you can create a card (a styled content container) by creating an element with the card class and card-body child. You can then include other nested elements with classes such as card-img-top, card-title, or card-text to produce further styled effects: &lt;div class=\"card\"> &lt;!-- the card --> &lt;img class=\"card-img-top\" src=\"...\" alt=\"image at top of card image\"> &lt;div class=\"card-body\"> &lt;!-- the \"body\" of the card --> &lt;h4 class=\"card-title\">A Card Title&lt;/h4> &lt;p class=\"card-text\">Some card text that appears below the card title.&lt;/p> &lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"card-link\">Action Link 1&lt;/a> &lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"card-link\">Action Link 2&lt;/a> &lt;/div> &lt;/div> (See this code in CodePen). Many of these components include some form of interactivity: for example, the navbar will “collapse” into a hamburger menu on small devices, while modals add in-page pop-up dialogs. CSS is not capable of adding this level of interactivity—that requires JavaScript. Thus to support these components, you also need to include the Bootstrap JavaScript library (as well as its dependency). &lt;!-- dependency: jQuery --> &lt;script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;!-- dependency: popper --> &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.0/umd/popper.min.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;!-- the Bootstrap JavaScript library --> &lt;script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/js/bootstrap.min.js\">&lt;/script> See the chapter on JavaScript for more details on including JavaScript libraries. Note that not all components or utilities require JavaScript. However, with most Bootstrap components, you don’t actually need to write any JavaScript code. Instead, you just need to provide some particular data- HTML attributes, and the library will take care of everything else. A data attributes is an normal HTML attribute that begins with the text data- (e.g., data-thingamabob or data-my-attribute). The HTML specification explicitly says that attributes that begin with data- are legal but not part of the standard, thus enabling them to be used for storing app-specific information. They effectively act as custom “variables” for elements that do not violate the HTML standard. For example, consider the below code for defining a modal and a button to open it: &lt;!-- note that the `id` attribute is set to \"exampleModal\" --> &lt;div id=\"exampleModal\" class=\"modal fade\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"exampleModalLabel\" aria-hidden=\"true\"> &lt;div class=\"modal-dialog\" role=\"document\"> &lt;div class=\"modal-content\"> &lt;div class=\"modal-header\"> &lt;h5 id=\"exampleModalLabel\" class=\"modal-title\">Modal title&lt;/h5> &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\"> &lt;span aria-hidden=\"true\">&amp;times;&lt;/span> &lt;/button> &lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"modal-body\">Some content shown in the body of the modal&lt;/div> &lt;div class=\"modal-footer\"> &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close&lt;/button> &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Save changes&lt;/button> &lt;/div> &lt;/div> &lt;/div> &lt;/div> &lt;!-- data-toggle must be set to \"modal\" and data-target must be set to the value of the `id` attribute on the element that starts your modal markup --> &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#exampleModal\">Open the Modal&lt;/button> (Try it out in CodePen). There is a lot to unpack in this code, including styling classes and ARIA attributes (e.g., role, aria-labelledby, and aria-hidden). The important part is that the root .modal element is hidden (display:none) when the page first loads. But when you click on the &lt;button&gt;, the included JavaScript library sees that it has a data-toggle=\"modal\" attribute, and determines that clicking the button should show the modal. The JavaScript using the data-target attribute on that button to determine which modal to open (finding the modal with that id), and then shows it. The data-dismiss attribute on the first &lt;button&gt; inside the modal allows it to be closed. The best way to understand these components is to start from the examples in the documentation, and then consider each element and attribute one at a time. Read the documentation! The JavaScript included in these CSS frameworks allows you to easily add interactive features, but they do not mix well with more advanced JavaScript frameworks like React. To work with React, you’d need to switch instead to a library such as reactstrap, which uses the Bootstrap 4 CSS stylesheet, but re-implement the JavaScript portions to fit into the React framework.

But they are not “full” (i.e., Turing Complete) programming languages—they don’t have variables, control structures, or other features required for the computer to execute an algorithm. So to make interactive websites or complex web applications, you need a complete programming language. And the language used by browsers is JavaScript. This chapter introduces the fundamentals of the JavaScript language as used in web development, focusing on variables, data types, and basic control structures. Functions are introduced, but addressed in more detail in the next chapter. Note, this course assumes you already are already familiar with introductory programming in a imperative language such as Java. It focuses on how JavaScript differs from languages such as Java, rather than foundational programming concepts. If you need review on those topics, you can check out a basic programming tutorial or review your notes from a previous programming course. 10.1 Programming with JavaScript JavaScript is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, allowing you to declare instructions for the computer in an almost-human readable way (similar to Java). JavaScript is an imperative language, so you write algorithms as step-by-step instructions (lines of code) using JavaScript’s syntax, and the computer will interpret these instructions in order to execute the algorithm. Browsers are able to download scripts written in JavaScript, executing them line-by-line and using those instructions to manipulate what content is displayed. Indeed, JavaScript is an interpreted language, in that the computer (specifically a JavaScript Interpreter) translates the high-level language into machine language on the fly at runtime. The interpreter will read and execute one line of code at a time, executing that line before it even begins to consider the next. This is in contrast with compiled languages like C or Java that have the computer do the translation in one pass (at compile-time), and then only execute the program after the whole thing is converted to machine language. This on-the-fly translation means that interpreted languages like JavaScript are usually slower than compiled languages, but not enough that we’ll notice (web browsers include highly optimized interpreters). The bigger drawback is that without the compile step, program errors appear at runtime rather than compile time, making them more difficult to catch and fix. As such, JavaScript developers make heavy use of various linting tools (which flag common problems that can lead to runtime errors), as well as automated testing systems to check against a variety of inputs. Many JavaScript editors do this kind of error checking—for example, VS Code provides syntax error checking out of the box, with more detailed linting available through extensions. See this article for more code features that support programming in JavaScript, including IntelliSense and type checking. Although JavaScript was designed for and is most commonly used within web browsers (which contain their own JavaScript Interpreters), it can also be executed on the command line by using Node.js, allowing JavaScript to be a fully general language. Both techniques are described in this chapter. History and Versions The JavaScript language was developed by Brendan Eich (the co-founder of Mozilla) in 1995 while he was working for Netscape. The original prototype of the language was created in 10 days… a fact which may help explain some of the quirks in the language. Despite the names, JavaScript and the Java language have nothing to do with one another (and are in fact totally separate programming languages used in drastically different contexts). JavaScript was named after Java as a marketing ploy to cash in on the popularity of the latter. It is the programming equivalent of the Transmorphers movie. The JavaScript language is officially an implementation of ECMAScript (named for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) specification. Hence versions of JavaScript are labeled with the prefix “ES”. For example, this chapter describes ES5 (JavaScript 5) syntax. Like HTML and CSS, the JavaScript language continues to be developed and refined through new versions. Each new version of JavaScript includes additional syntax shorts, specialized keywords, and additional core functions, but otherwise are compatible with previous code. The main limitation on utilizing new JavaScript features is whether the interpreters found in web browsers are able to support them. This course primarily utilizes syntax and features for ES5, which was introduced in 2009 and today is supported by all modern browsers (i.e., IE 10 or later). Later chapters will describe features of ES6 (also called ES2015), which was introduced in 2015 and works on many browsers (e.g., Microsoft Edge but not IE 11). ES7 was finalized in 2016 but is still not reliably supported. Note that Microsoft no longer supports earlier versions of IE, but a small percentage of desktops still run Windows XP with IE 8. If you must support these browsers, you can often use a “transpiler” like Babel to translate modern JavaScript source code into an earlier version. 10.2 Running JavaScript There are two primary ways of executing code written in JavaScript: In the Browser JavaScript scripts are most commonly executed in a web browser as part of the browser rendering a web page. Since browsers render HTML content (in .html files), JavaScript scripts are included in that HTML by using a &lt;script&gt; tag and specifying the relative path to the a file containing the code (usually a .js file) to execute. When the browser renders the HTML (reading top to bottom) and gets to that tag, it will download and execute the specified script file using the JavaScript interpreter: &lt;!-- execute the script.js file --> &lt;script src=\"path/to/my/script.js\">&lt;/script> Notice that the &lt;script&gt; element is not empty! It is possible to include JavaScript code directly inside the tag, but this is considered bad practice (keep concerns separated!) and should only be used for quick tests. The &lt;script&gt; tag can be included anywhere in an HTML page. Most commonly it is either placed in the &lt;head&gt; in order for the script to be executed before the page content loads, or at the very end of the &lt;body&gt; in order for the script to be executed after the page content loads (and thus allows the JavaScript to immediately interact with the loaded HTML elements). We will (begin by) most commonly be putting &lt;script&gt; tags at the end of the &lt;body&gt;: &lt;!DOCTYPE html> &lt;html> &lt;head> &lt;!-- include here to run before the page appears --> &lt;script src=\"js/script.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;/head> &lt;body> ... content ... &lt;!-- include here to run \"after\" html appears --> &lt;!-- we will usually do this --> &lt;script src=\"js/script.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;/body> &lt;html> Most browsers also support adding a defer attribute to the &lt;script&gt; element that tells the browser to defer downloading and running the script until the page is fully loaded and rendered to the screen. With this attribute, you can put the &lt;script&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; without any issues. However, this attribute is not supported in IE 9 or earlier; it is thus still best practice to put the &lt;script&gt; element at the end of the body. While JavaScript most commonly is used to manipulate the web page content and is thus pretty obvious to the user, it also can produce “terminal-like” output—including printed text and error messages. This output can be viewed through the JavaScript Console included as a developer tool in the Chrome browser (other browsers include similar tools): Accessing the developer console in Chrome. Important: You should always have the JavaScript Console open when developing JavaScript code, since this is where any error messages will appear! On the Command-line with Node.js It is also possible to execute JavaScript code on the command line using Node.js. Node is a command line runtime environment—that is, a JavaScript interpreter that can be run on the command line. With Node installed on your machine, you can use the node terminal command to start an interactive Node session. This will allow you to type JavaScript code directly in the terminal, and your computer will interpret and execute each line of code: An interactive Node session. You can enter one line of code at a time at the prompt (&gt;). This is a nice way to experiment with the JavaScript language or to quickly run and test some code. You can exit this session by typing the quit() command, or hitting ctrl-z (followed by Enter on Windows). Note that the JavaScript console in the Chrome Developer tools provides the same interactive functionality. It is also possible to run entire scripts (.js files) from the command line by using the Node command and specifying the script file you wish to execute: node my-script.js This allows you author entire programs in JavaScript (e.g., writing the code using VS Code), and then executing them from the command line. This process is more common when doing server-side web development (such as implementing a web server using Node), but we will still use it for practice and testing. 10.3 Writing Scripts Unlike Java or C, JavaScript has no main() method that “starts” the program. Instead, a JavaScript script (a .js file) contains a sequence of statements (instructions) that the interpreter executes in order, one at a time, top to bottom—just as if you had typed them into an interactive session one after another. Each line can declare a variable or function, which will then be available to the next statement to use or call. Thus with a JavaScript program, you should think of the sequence of steps you want to be performed, and write lines of code in that order. In a way, you can think of the entire file as the “body” of a main() method… except that this body will contain further function declarations. For example: /* script.js */ /* This is the ENTIRE contents of the file! */ console.log(\"Hello world!\"); //this is executed first console.log(\"I'm doing JavaScript!\"); //this is executed second The above example code demonstrates the console.log() function, which is JavaScript’s equivalent to Java’s System.out.println()—the output will be shown in the JavaScript console (in the Developer Tools). Thus we talk about “logging out” values in JavaScript, instead of “printing” values in Java. The console.log() function is technically a log() method belonging being called on a global console object. Globals and objects will be discussed in more detail below. Don’t forget the semicolons! As in Java, each statement should end with a semicolon (;) marking the end of that statement. But unlike Java, JavaScript can be forgiving if you forget a semicolon. The JavaScript interpreter tries to be “helpful” and will often assume that statements end at the end of a line if the next line “looks like” a new statement. However, it occasionally screws up in horrible ways—and so best practice as a developer is to always include the semicolons. Strict Mode ES5 includes the ability for JavaScript to be interpreted in strict mode. Strict mode is more “strict” about how the interpreter understands the syntax: it is less likely to assume that certain programmer mistakes were intentional (and so try to run the code anyway). For example, in strict mode the interpreter will produce an Error if you try and use a variable that has not yet been defined, while without strict mode the code will just use an undefined value. Thus working in strict mode can help catch a lot of silly mistakes. You declare that a script or function should be executed in strict mode by putting an interpreter declaration at the top: 'use strict'; This is not a String (or even JavaScript code!), but rather a declaration to the interpreter about how that interpreter should behave. ALWAYS USE STRICT MODE! It will help avoid typo-based bugs, as well as enable your code to run more efficiently. 10.4 Variables Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed. This means that variables are not declared as a particular type (e.g., int or String), but instead take on the data type (Number, String, etc.) of the value currently assigned to that variable. As we don’t specify the data type, JavaScript variables are declared using the let keyword: let message = 'Hello World'; //a String console.log(typeof message); //=> `string` let shoeSize = 7; //a Number console.log(typeof shoeSize); //=> 'number' The typeof operator will return the data type of a variable. It is not widely used outside of debugging. As in Java, JavaScript variables should be given descriptive names using camelCase. Pro Tip: Even though variables in JavaScript loosely typed, the data type of a value is still important! In order to help keep track of the type of each variable in JavaScript, include the type in the variable name. For example: textString, wordsArray, totalNum, itemStr, etc.. Declared variables have a default value of undefined—a value representing that the variable has no value. This is somewhat similar to null in Java (though JavaScript also as an null value that is not commonly used): //create a variable (not assigned) let hoursSlept; console.log(hoursSlept); //=> undefined Note that the let keyword is in fact new syntax introduced with ES6: older versions of JavaScript used the var keyword instead (and you will see var in most existing examples and tutorials). The difference is that variables declared with let are “block scoped”, meaning they are only available within the block (the {}) in which they are defined. This is the same way variables are scoped in Java. Variables declared with var, on the other hand, are “functionally scoped” so are available anywhere within the function in which they are defined. This means that you could declare a variable within an if block, and that variable would continue to be available outside that block! Thus let allows for cleaner, more efficient code, and with less bugs. let is the one ES6 feature supported by IE 11, meaning it can be used with most current browsers. However, if you do need to support an older browser (e.g., IE 10, Safari 9.3, Android 4.4), you should transpile your code or stick to using var Along with let, JavaScript variables can also be declared using the const keyword to indicate that they are constant (similar to what the final keyword does in Java). A const variable is block scoped, but can only be assigned once: const ISCHOOL_URL = 'https://ischool.uw.edu'; //declare constant ISCHOOL_URL = 'https://example.com'; //TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. Basic Data Types JavaScript supports many of the same basic data types as Java and other languages: Numbers are used to represent numeric data (JavaScript does not distinguish between integers and floats). Numbers support the same mathematical and operators as Java. Common mathematical functions can be accessed through in the built-in Math global (similar to Java’s Math class). let x = 5; typeof x; //'number' let y = x/4; typeof y; //'number' //numbers use floating point division console.log( x/4 ); //1.25 //use the Math.floor() function to do integer division console.log( Math.floor(x/4) ); //1 //other common Math functions available as well console.log( Math.sqrt(x) ); //2.23606797749979 Strings can be written in either single quotes (') or double quotes (\"), but most style guidelines recommend single quotes—just be consistent! Strings can be concatenated as in Java: let name = 'Joel'; let greeting = 'Hello, my name is '+name; //concatenation Strings also support many methods for working with them. As with Java, JavaScript strings are immutable, so most string methods return a new, altered string. let message = 'Hello World'; let shouted = message.toUpperCase(); console.log(shouted); //=> 'HELLO WORLD' Booleans (true and false) in JavaScript work the same way as in Java, can be produced using the same relational operators (e.g., &lt;, &gt;=, !=), and support the same logical operators (e.g., &amp;&amp;, ||, and !): //conjunction (and) boolOne &amp;&amp; boolTwo //disjunction (or) boolOne || boolTwo //negation (not) !boolOne //not See Type Coercion and Control Structures below for more on working with Booleans in JavaScript. Arrays JavaScript also supports arrays, which are ordered, one-dimensional sequences of values. As in Java, JavaScript Arrays are written as literals inside square brackets []. Individual elements can be accessed by (0-based) index using bracket notation. //an array of names let names = ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo']; //an array of numbers (can contain \"duplicate\" values) let numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 8]; //arrays can contain different types (including other arrays!) let things = ['raindrops', 2.5, true, [3, 4, 3]]; //arrays can be empty (contain no elements) let empty = []; //access using bracket notation console.log( names[1] ); // \"Paul\" console.log( things[3][2] ); // 3 numbers[0] = '340'; //assign new value at index 0 console.log( numbers ); // [340, 2, 2, 3, 5, 8] Note that it is possible to assign a value to any index in the array, even if that index is “out of bounds”. This will grow the array (increase its length) to include that index—intermediate indices will be given values of undefined. The length of the array (accessed via the .length attribute) will always be the index of the “last” element + 1, even if there are fewer defined values within the array. let letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']; console.log(letters.length); // 3 letters[5] = 'f'; //grows the array console.log(letters); // [ 'a', 'b', 'c', , , 'f' ] //blank spaces are undefined console.log(letters.length); // 6 Arrays also support a variety of methods that can be used to easily modify their elements, similar to the ArrayList class in Java: //Make a new array let array = ['i','n','f','o']; //add item to end of the array array.push('340'); console.log(array); //=> ['i','n','f','o','340'] //combine elements into a string let str = array.join('-'); console.log(str); //=> \"i-n-f-o-340\" //get index of an element (first occurrence) let oIndex = array.indexOf('o'); //=> 3 //remove 1 element starting at oIndex array.splice(oIndex, 1); console.log(array); //=> ['i','n','f','340'] Objects The most generic and useful data type in JavaScript is the Object data type. An Object is a lot like an array in that it is in that it is a (one-dimensional) sequence of values that are all stored in a single variable. However, rather than using integers as the index for each element, an Object uses Strings. Thus Objects are unordered sequences of key-value pairs, where the keys (called “properties”) are arbitrary Strings and the values are any data type—each property can be used to look up (reference) the value associated with it. This is a lot like a real-world dictionary or encyclopedia, in which the words (keys) are used to look up the definitions (values). A phone book works the same way (the names are the keys, the phone numbers are the values). A JavaScript Object provides a mapping from properties to values. JavaScript Objects are similar data structures to Java HashMaps, Python dictionaries, R lists, or even an HTML &lt;dl&gt; descriptive list! More generally, these are known as associative arrays (they are arrays that “associate” a key and a value). As with other associative arrays, JavaScript Objects are implemented as hash tables, making data access very fast. Objects are written as literals inside curly braces {}. Property-value pairs are written with a colon (:) between the property name and the value, and each element (pair) in the Object is separated by a comma (,). Note that the property names do not need to be written in quotes if they are a single word (the quotes are implied—properties are always Strings): //an object of ages (explicit Strings for keys) //The `ages` object has a `sarah` property (with a value of 42) let ages = {'sarah':42, 'amit':35, 'zhang':13}; //different properties can have the same values //property names with non-letter characters must be in quotes let meals = {breakfast:'coffee', lunch: 'coffee', 'afternoon tea': 'coffee'} //values can be of different types (including arrays or other objects!) let typeExamples = {number:12, string:'dog', array:[1,2,3]}; //objects can be empty (contains no properties) let empty = {} Important note: Objects are an unordered collection of key-value pairs! Because you reference a value by its property name and not by its position (as you do in an array), the exact ordering of those elements doesn’t matter—the interpreter just goes immediately to the value associated with the property. This almost means that when you log out an Object, the order in which the properties are printed may not match the order in which you specified them in the literal. If you console.log() an object, you will usually see a nicely format version of that object. However, if you try to convert that object to a string (e.g., via concatenation: let output = \"my object: \"+myObject), you will instead be presented with the “string version” of that object: [object Object]. This is not an array, but the String version of an object (similar to the hash you get when you try and print a Java array directly). You can instead use the fact that console.log accepts multiple parameters to output an object with a leading string: let myObject = {a:1, b:2} //convert object to string, won't log nicely console.log(\"My object: \" + myObject); //=> My object: [object Object] //log the object directly console.log(\"My object \", myObject); //=> My object {a: 1, b: 2} Despite the name, JavaScript Objects have nothing to do with Object-Oriented Programing. However, they can be used to represent “things” in the same way as a Java object, with each property acting like an “attribute” (instance variable): //an object representing a Person (spacing is for readability; white-space is ignored) let person = { firstName: 'Alice', lastName: 'Smith', age: 40, pets: ['rover', 'fluffy', 'mittens'], //value is an array favorites: { //value is another object music: 'jazz', food: 'pizza', numbers: [12, 42] //value is an array } } Accessing Objects Similar to arrays, Object values can be access via bracket notation, specifying the property name as the index. If an object does not explicitly have a property value, accessing that key produces undefined (the property’s value is undefined). let favorites = {music: 'jazz', food: 'pizza', numbers: [12, 42]}; //access variable console.log( favorites['music'] ); //'jazz' //assign variable favorites['food'] = 'cake'; //property name is a string console.log( favorites['food'] ); //'cake' //access undefined key console.log( favorites['language'] ); //undefined favorites['language'] = 'javascript'; //assign new key and value //access nested values console.log( favorites['numbers'][0] ); //12 //use a variable as the \"key\" let userInputtedTopic = 'food'; //pretend this value is supplied dynamically console.log(favorites[userInputtedTopic]); //'cake' Additionally, Object values can also be accessed via dot notation, as if the properties were public attributes of a class instance. This is often simpler to write and to read: remember to read the . as an 's! let favorites = {music: 'jazz', food: 'pizza', numbers: [12, 42]}; //access variable console.log( favorites.music ); //'jazz' //assign variable favorites.food = 'cake'; console.log( favorites.food ); //'cake' //access undefined key console.log( favorites.language ); //undefined favorites.language = 'javascript'; //assign new key and value //access nested values console.log( favorites.numbers[0] ); //12 The only advantage to using bracket notation is that you can specify property names as variables or the results of an expression. But overall, the recommendation is to use dot notation unless the property you wish to access is dynamically determined. It is possible to get an array of an object’s keys calling the Object.keys() method and passing in the object you wish to get the keys of. Note that an equivalent function for values is not supported by most browsers; a better approach is to iterate through the keys to identify all the values. let ages = {sarah:42, amit:35, zhang:13}; let keys = Object.keys(ages); // [ 'sarah', 'amit', 'zhang' ] Arrays of Objects As noted above, both arrays and objects can have values of any type—including other arrays or objects! The ability to nest objects inside of objects is incredibly powerful, and allows us to define arbitrarily complex information structurings (schemas). Indeed, most data in computer programs—as well as public information available on the web—is structured as a set of nested maps like this (though possibly with some level of abstraction). One of the most common forms of nesting you’ll see is to have an array of objects where each object has the same properties (but different values). For example: //an arbitrary list of people's names, heights, and weights let people = [ {name: 'Ada', height: 58, 'weight': 115}, {name: 'Bob', height: 59, 'weight': 117}, {name: 'Chris', height: 60, 'weight': 120}, {name: 'Diya', height: 61, 'weight': 123}, {name: 'Emma', height: 62, 'weight': 126} ] This structure can be seen as a list of records (the objects), each of which have a number of different features (the key-value pairs). This list of feature records is in fact a common way of understanding a data table like you would create as an Excel spreadsheet: A data table. Each object (record) acts as a “row” in the table, and each property (feature) acts as a “column”. As long as all of the objects share the same keys, this array of objects is a table! Type Coercion As mentioned above, variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed, and thus have a data type of the value currently assigned to that variable. JavaScript variables are able to “change type” by having a different type of data assignment to them: let myVariable = 'hello'; //value is a String myVariable = 42; //value is now a Number Unlike some other dynamically typed variables, JavaScript will not throw errors if you try to apply operators (such as + or &lt;) to different types. Instead, the interpreter will try to be “helpful” and coerce (convert) a value from one data type into another. While this process is similar to how Java will automatically cast data types into Strings (e.g., \"hello\"+4), JavaScript’s type coercion can produce a few quirks: let x = '40' + 2; console.log(x); //=> '402'; the 2 is coerced to a String let y = '40' - 4; console.log(y); //=> 36; can't subtract strings so '40' is coerced to a Number! JavaScript will also attempt to coerce values when checking for equality with ==: let num = 10 let str = '10' console.log(num == str) //true, the values can be coerced into one another In this case, the interpreter will coerce the Number 10 into the String '10' (since numbers can always be made into Strings), and since those Strings are the same, determines that the variables are equal. In general this type of automatic coercion can lead to subtle bugs. Thus you should instead always use the === operator (and it’s partner !==), which checks both value and type for equality: let num = 10 let str = '10' console.log(num === str) //false, the values have different types JavaScript will do its best to coerce any value when compared. Often this means converting values to Strings, but it will also commonly convert values into booleans to compare them. So for example: //compare an empty String to the number 0 console.log( '' == 0 ); //true; both can be coerced to a `false` value This is because both the empty string '' and 0 are considered “falsey” values (values that can be coerced to false). Other falsy values include undefined, null, and NaN (not a number). All other values will be coerced to true. For more examples of the horror of JavaScript coercion, see this video (about 1:20 in). 10.5 Control Structures JavaScript control structures have a similar syntax to those in Java or C. For example, a JavaScript if statement is written as: if(condition){ //statements } else if(alternativeCondition) { //statements } else { //statements } The condition can be any expression that evaluates to a Boolean value. But since any value can be coerced into Booleans, you can put any value you want inside the if condition. This is actually really useful—since undefined is a falsy value, you can use this coercion to check if a variable has been assigned or not: //check if a `person` variable has a `name` property if(person.name){ console.log('Person does have a name!'); } In the above example, the condition will only coerce to true if person.name is defined (not undefined) and is not empty. If somehow the variable has not been assigned (e.g., the user didn’t fill out the form completely), then the condition will not be true. While using person.name !== undefined is an equivalent expression, it is more idiomatic to utilize the coercion and have plain variable as the conditional expression. Additionally, JavaScript provides a ternary conditional operator that lets you write a simple if statement as a single expression: let x; //declare variable if(condition) { x = 'foo'; } else { x = 'bar'; } //can be condensed into: let x = condition ? 'foo' : 'bar'; This expression is read as “if condition then resolve to 'foo' else resolve to bar”. Each part (the condition, the “if true” result, and the “if false” result) can be any expression, though you should keep them simple to avoid confusion. JavaScript also supports while loop (for indefinite iteration) and for loops (for definite iteration) similar to Java. The only difference is that because JavaScript variables are dynamically typed, the loop control variables are not declared with a type: //an example for loop. The `i` is not declared as an int for(let i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++){ console.log(array[i]); } JavaScript does have a for ... in syntax. However, it doesn’t work as you would expect for arrays (it iterates over “enumerable properties” rather than the specific indices), and so should not be used with arrays. ES6 also introduces a for ... of syntax for iterating over arrays, but this is not supported by all browsers and so is not recommended. Instead, the current best practice is to use the above for loop, or better yet the forEach() method described in the next chapter. If you need to iterate over the keys of an object, use the Object.keys() method to get an array to loop through! 10.6 Functions And of course, JavaScript includes functions (named sequences of statements used to abstract code). JavaScript functions are written using the following syntax: //A function named `makeFullName` that takes two arguments //and returns the \"full name\" made from them function makeFullName(firstName, lastName) { //Function body: perform tasks in here let fullName = firsName + \" \" + lastName; // Return: what you want the function to output return fullName; } // Call the makeFullName function with the values \"Alice\" and \"Kim\" // Assign the result to `myName` let myName = makeFullName(\"Alice\", \"Kim\") // \"Alice Kim\" Functions are defined by using the function keyword (placed before the name of the function) instead of Java’s public static, don’t declare a return type (since the language is dynamically typed), and don’t indicate types for the parameters. Otherwise, JavaScript functions have identical syntax to Java functions. If a function lacks a return value, then that function returns the value undefined. As in other languages, function arguments in JavaScript are implicitly declared local variables. However, in JavaScript all arguments are optional. Any argument that is not passed a specific value will be undefined. Any passed in value that does not have a variable declared for its position will not be assigned to a variable. function sayHello(name) { return \"Hello, \"+name; } //expected: argument is assigned a value sayHello(\"Joel\"); //\"Hello, Joel\" //argument not assigned a value (left undefined) sayHello(); //\"Hello, undefined\" //extra arguments (values) are not assigned to variables, so are ignored sayHello(\"Joel\", \"y'all\"); //\"Hello, Joel\" If a function has an argument, that doesn’t mean it got a value. If a function lacks an argument, that doesn’t mean it wasn’t given a value! In addition to this basic structure, JavaScript functions are frequently used for functional programming, as described in the next chapter.

Scheme is a functional programming language, which means it follows a programming paradigm centered on functions rather than on variables, objects, and statements as you’ve done before (known as imperative programming). An alternative to object-oriented programming, functional programming provides a framework for thinking about how to give instructions to a computer. While JavaScript is not a fully functional language, it does support a number of functional programming features that are vital to developing effective and interactive systems. This chapter introduces these functional concepts. 11.1 Functions ARE Variables Normally you’ve considered functions as “named sequences of instructions”, or groupings of lines of code that are given a name. But in a functional programming paradigm, functions are first-class citizens—that is, they are “things” (values) that can be organized and manipulated just like variables. In JavaScript, functions ARE variables: //create a function called `sayHello` function sayHello(name) { console.log(\"Hello, \"+name); } //what kind of thing is `sayHello` ? console.log(typeof sayHello); //=> 'function' Just like let x = 3 defines a variable for a value of type number, or let msg = \"hello\" defines a variable for a value of type string, the above sayHello function is actually a variable for a value of type function! Important: we refer to a function by it’s name without the parentheses! The fact that functions are variables is the core realization to make when programming in a functional style. You need to be able to think about functions as things (nouns), rather than as behaviors (verbs). If you imagine that functions are “recipes”, then you need to think about them as pages from the cookbook (that can be bound together or handed to a friend), rather than just the sequence of actions that they tell you to perform. And because functions are just another type of variable, they can be used anywhere that a “regular” variable can be used. For example, functions are values, so they can be assigned to other variables! //create a function called `sayHello` function sayHello(name) { console.log(\"Hello, \"+name); } //assign the `sayHello` value to a new variable `greet` let greet = sayHello; //call the function assigned to the `greet` variable greet(\"world\"); //logs \"Hello world\" It helps to think of functions as just a special kind of array. Just as arrays have a special syntax [] (bracket notation) that can be used to “get” a value from the list, functions have a special syntax () (parentheses) that can be used to “run” the function. Anonymous Functions Functions are values, just like arrays and objects. And just as arrays and objects can be written as literals which can be anonymously passed into functions, JavaScript supports anonymous functions: var array = [1,2,3]; //named variable (not anonymous) console.log(array); //pass in named var console.log( [4,5,6] ); //pass in anonymous value //named function (normal) function sayHello(person){ console.log(\"Hello, \"+person); } //an anonymous function (with no name!) //(We can't reference this without a name, so writing an anonymous function is //not a valid statement) function(person) { console.log(\"Hello, \"+person); } //anonymous function (value) assigned to variable //equivalent to the version in the previous example let sayHello = function(person) { console.log(\"Hello, \"+person); } You can think of this structure as equivalent to declaring and assigning an array let myVar = [1,2,3]… just in this case instead of taking the anonymous array (right-hand side) and giving it a name, we’re taking an anonymous function and giving it a name! Thus you can define named functions in one of to ways: either by making an explicitly named function or by assigning an anonymous function to a variable: //these produce the same function function foo(bar) {} let foo = function(bar) {} The only difference between these two constructions is one of ordering. When the JavaScript interpreter is initially reading and parsing the script file, it will put variable and function declarations into memory before it executes any of the file. In effect, JavaScript will seem to “move” variable and function declarations to the top of the file! This process is called hoisting (declarations are “hoisted” to the top of the script). Hoisting only works for named function declarations: assigning an anonymous function to a variable will not hoist that function’s definition: In practice, you should always declare and define functions before you use them (put them all at the top of the file!), which will reduce the impact of hoisting and allow you to use either construction. 11.2 Object Functions Moreover, functions are values, so they can be assigned as values of object properties (since object properties are like name-spaced variables): //an object representing a dog let dog = { name: 'Sparky' breed: 'mutt' } //assign an anonymous function to the `bark` property dog.bark = function(){ console.log('woof!'); } //call the function dog.bark(); //logs \"woof!\" Again, this is just like how you can assign an array as an object’s property. With an array value you would use bracket notation to use it’s “special power”; with a function value you use parentheses! This is how we can create an equivalent of “member functions” (or methods) for individual objects: the dog object now has a function bark()! Similar to Java, you can refer to the object on which a function is called using the keyword this. Note that the manner in which the this variable is assigned can lead to some subtle errors when using callback functions (below). For more details, see the chapter on ES6 features. As a brief example: // An object representing a Dog let fido = { name: \"Fido\", bark: function() { console.log(this.name, \"woofs\")} } // An object representing another Dog let spot = { name: \"Spot\", bark: function() { console.log(this.name, \"yips\")} } console.log('***This is Fido barking:***'); fido.bark(); //=> \"Fido woofs\". Note, `this` will refer to the `fido` object. console.log('***This is Spot barking***'); spot.bark(); //=> \"Spot yips\". Note, `this` will refer to the `spot` object. 11.3 Callback Functions Finally, functions are values, so they can be passed as parameters to other functions! //create a function `sayHello` function sayHello(name){ console.log(\"Hello, \"+name); } //a function that takes ANOTHER FUNCTION as an argument //this function will call the argument function, passing it \"world\" function doWithWorld(funcToCall){ //call the given function with an argument of \"world\" funcToCall(\"world\"); } doWithWorld(sayHello); //logs \"Hello world\"; In this case, the doWithWorld function will execute whatever function it is given, passing in a value of \"world\". Important note: when we pass sayHello as an argument, we don’t put any parentheses after it! Putting the parentheses after the function name executes the function, causing it to perform the lines of code it defines. This will cause the expression containing the function to resolve to its returned value, rather than being the function value itself. It’s like passing in the baked cake rather than the recipe page. function greet() { //version with no args for clarity return \"Hello\"; } //log out the function value itself console.log(greet); //logs e.g., [Function: greet], the function console.log(greet()); //logs \"Hello\", which is what `sayHello()` resolves to A function that is passed into another is commonly referred to as a callback function: it is an argument that the other function will “call back to” and execute when needed. function doLater(callback) { console.log(\"I'm waiting a bit...\"); console.log(\"Okay, time to work!\"); callback(); //\"call back\" and execute that function } function doHomework() { // ... }; doLater(doHomework); Functions can take more than one callback function as arguments, which can be a useful way of composing behaviors. function doTogether(firstCallback, secondCallback){ firstCallback(); //execute the first function secondCallback(); //execute the second function console.log('at the same time!'); } function patHead() { console.log('pat your head'); } function rubBelly() { console.log('rub your belly'); } //pass in the callbacks to do them together doTogether(patHead, rubBelly); This idea of passing functions are arguments to other functions is at the heart of functional programming, and is what gives it expressive power: we can define program behavior primarily in terms of the behaviors that are run, and less in terms of the data variables used. Moreover, callback functions are vital for supporting interactivity: many built-in JavaScript functions take in a callback function that specifies what should occur at some specific time (e.g., when the user clicks a button). Often a callback function will be defined just to be passed into a single other function. This makes naming the callback somewhat redundant, and so it is more common to utilize anonymous callback functions: //name anonymous function by assigning to variable let sayHello = function(name){ console.log(\"Hello, \"+name); } function doWithWorld(funcToCall){ funcToCall(\"world\"); } //pass the named function by name doWithWorld(sayHello); //pass in anonymous version of the function doWithWorld(function(name){ console.log(\"Hello, \"+name); }); In a way, we’ve just “copy-and-pasted” the anonymous value (which happens to be a function) into the doWithWorld() call—just as you would do with any other anonymous variable type. Look carefully at the location of the closing brace } and parenthesis ) on the last line. The brace ends the definition of the anonymous function value (the first and only parameter to doWithWorld), and the parenthesis ends the parameter list of the doWithWorld function. You need to include both for the syntax to be valid! And since anonymous functions can be defined within other anonymous functions, it is not unusual to have lots of }) lines in your code. Closures Functions are values, so not only can then be passed as parameters to other functions, they can also be returned as results of other functions! //This function produces ANOTHER FUNCTION //which greets a person with a given greeting function makeGreeterFunc(greeting){ //explicitly store the param as a local variable (for clarity) let localGreeting = greeting; //A new function that uses the `greeting` param //this is just a value! let aGreeterFunc = function(name){ console.log(localGreeting+\" \"+name); } return aGreeterFunc; //return the value (which happens to be a function) } //Use the \"maker\" to create two new functions let sayHello = makeGreeterFunc('Hello'); //says 'Hello' to a name let sayHowdy = makeGreeterFunc('Howdy'); //says 'Howdy' to a name //call the functions that were made sayHello('world'); //\"Hello world\" sayHello('Dave'); //\"Hello Dave\" sayHowdy('world'); //\"Howdy wold\" sayHowdy('partner'); //\"Howdy partner\" In this example, we’ve defined a function makeGreeterFunc that takes in some information (a greeting) as a parameter. It uses that information to create a new function aGreeterFunc—this function will have different behavior depending on the parameter (e.g., it can say “Hello” or “Howdy” or any other greeting given). We then return this new aGreeterFunc so that it can be used later (outside of the “maker” function). When we then call the makeGreeterFunc(), the result (a function) is assigned to a variable (e.g., sayHello). And because that result is a function, we can call it with a parameter! Thus makeGreeterFunc acts a bit like a “factory” for making other functions, which can then be used where needed. The most significant part of this example is the scoping of the greeting variable (and its localGreeting alias). Normally, you would think about localGreeting as being scoped to makeGreeterFunc—once the maker function is finished, then the localGreeting variable should be lost. However, the greeting variable was in scope when the aGreeterFunc was created, and thus remains in scope (available) for that aGreeteFunc even after the maker function has returned! This structure in which a function “remembers” its context (the in-scope variables around it) is called a closure. Even though the localGreeting variable was scoped outside of the aGreeterFunc, it has been enclosed by that function so it continues to be available later. Closures are one of the most powerful yet confusing techniques in JavaScript, and are a highly effective way of saving data in variables (instead of relying on global variables or other poor programming styles). They will also be useful when dealing with some problems introduced by Asynchronous Programming 11.4 Functional Looping Another way that functional programming and callback functions specifically are utilized is to replace loops with function calls. For a number of common looping patterns, this can make the code more expressive—more clearly indicative of what it is doing and thus easier to understand. Functional looping was introduced in ES5. To understand functional looping, first consider the common for loop used to iterate through an array of objects: let array = [{...}, {...}, {...}]; for(let i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++){ let currentItem = array[i]; //convenience variable for current item //do something with current item console.log(currentItem); } While this loop may be familiar and fast, it does require extra work to manage the loop control variable (the i), which can get especially confusing when dealing with nested loops (and nested data structures are very common in JavaScript!) As an alternative, you can consider using the Array type’s forEach() method: let array = [{...}, {...}, {...}]; //function for what to do with each item function printItem(currentItem){ console.log(currentItem;) } //print out each item array.forEach(printItem); The forEach() method goes through each item in the array and executes the given callback function, passing that item as a parameter to the callback. In effect, it lets you specify “what to do with each element” in the array as a separate function, and then “apply” that function to each elements. forEach() is a built-in method for Arrays—similar to push() or indexOf(). For reference, the “implementation” of the forEach() function looks something like: Array.forEach = function(callback) { //define the Array's forEach method for(let i=0; i&lt;this.length; i++) { callback(this[i], i, this); } } In effect, the method does the job of managing the loop and the loop control variable for you, allowing you to just focus on what you want to do for each item. The callback function give to the forEach() will be executed with up to three argument (in order): (1) the current item in the array, (2) the index of the item in the array, and (3) the array itself. This means that your callback can contain up to three arguments, but since all arguments are optional in JavaScript, it can also be used with fewer—you don’t need to include an argument for the index or array if you aren’t utilizing them! While it is possible to make a named callback function for forEach(), it is much more common to use an anonymous callback function: //print each item in the array array.forEach(function(item){ console.log(item); }) This code can almost be read as: “take the array and forEach thing execute the function on that item”. This is similar in usage to the enhanced for loop in Java. Map JavaScript provides a number of other functional loop methods. For example, consider the following “regular” loop: function square(n) { //a function that squares a number return n*n; } let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]; //an initial array let squares = []; //the transformed array for(let i=0; i&lt;numbers.length; i++){ let transformed = square(numbers[i]); //call our square() function squares.push(transformed); //add transformed to the list } console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] This loop represents a mapping operation: it takes an original array (e.g., of numbers 1 to 5) and produces a new array with each of the original elements transformed in a certain way (e.g., squared). This is a common operation to apply: maybe you want to “transform” an array so that all the values are rounded or lowercase, or you want to map an array of words to an array of their lengths, or you want to map an array of values to an array of &lt;li&gt; HTML strings. It is possible to make all these changes using the above code pattern: create a new empty array, then loop through the original array and push the transformed values onto that new array. However, JavaScript also provides a built-in array method called map() that directly performs this kind of mapping operation on an array without needing to use a loop: function square(n) { //a function that squares a number return n*n; } let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]; //an initial array //map the numbers using the `square` transforming function let squares = numbers.map(square); console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] The array’s map() function produces a new array with each of the elements transformed. The map() function takes as an argument a callback function that will do the transformation. The callback function should take as an argument the element to transform, and return a value (the transformed element). Callback functions for map() will be passed the same three arguments as the callback functions for forEach(): the element, the index, and the array. And again, the map() callback function (e.g., square() in the above example) is more commonly written as an anonymous callback function: let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]; //an initial array let squares = numbers.map(function(item){ return item*item; }); Note: the major difference between the .forEach method and the .map method is that the .map method will return each element. If you need to create a new array, you should use .map. If you simply need to do something for each element in an array, use .forEach. Filter A second common operation is to filter a list of elements, removing elements that we don’t want (or more accurately: only keeping elements that we DO want). For example, consider the following loop: function isEven(n) { //a function that determines if a number is even let remainder = n % 2; //get remainder when dividing by 2 (modulo operator) return remainder == 0; //true if no remainder, false otherwise } let numbers = [2,7,1,8,3]; //an initial array let evens = []; //the filtered array for(let i=0; i&lt;numbers.length; i++){ if(isEven(numbers[i])){ evens.push(numbers[i]); } } console.log(evens); //[2, 8] With this filtering loop, we are keeping the values for which the isEven() function returns true (the function determines “what to let in” not “what to keep out”; a whitelist), which we do by appending the “good” values to a new array. Similar to map(), JavaScript arrays include a built-in method called filter() that will directly perform this filtering: function isEven(n) { //a function that determines if a number is even return (n % 2) == 0; //true if no remainder, false otherwise } let numbers = [2,7,1,8,3]; //an initial array let evens = numbers.filter(isEven); //the filtered array console.log(evens); //[2, 8] The array’s filter() function produces a new array that contains only the elements that do match a specific criteria. The filter() function takes as an argument a callback function that will make this decision. The callback function takes in the same arguments as forEach() and map(), and should return true if the given element should be included in the filtered array (or false if it should not). And again, we usually use anonymous callback functions for filter(): let numbers = [2,7,1,8,3]; //an initial array let evens = numbers.filter(function(n) { return (n%2)==0; }); //one-liner! (Since JavaScript ignores whitespace, we can compact simple callbacks onto a single line. ES6 and Beyond describes an even more compact syntax for such functions). Because map() and filter() are both called on and produce arrays, it is possible chain them together, calling subsequent methods on each returned value: let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]; //an initial array //get the squares of EVEN numbers only let filtered = numbers.filter(isEven); let squares = filtered.map(square); console.log(squares); //[4, 16, 36] //or in one statement, using results anonymously let squares = numbers.filter(isEven) .map(square); console.log(squares); //[4, 16, 36] This structure can potentially make it easier to understand the code’s intent than using a set of nested loops or conditionals: we are taking numbers and then filtering for the evens and mapping to squares! Reduce The third important operation in functional programming (besides mapping and filtering) is reducing an array. Reducing an array means to aggregate that array’s values together, transforming the array elements into a single value. For example, summing an array is a reducing operation (and in fact, the most common one!): it reduces an array of numbers to a single summed value. You can think of reduce() as a generalization of the sum() function found in many other languages—but rather than just adding (+) the values together, reduce() allows you to specify what operation to perform when aggregating (e.g., multiplication). To understand how a reduce operation works, consider the following basic loop: function add(x, y) { //a function that adds two numbers return x+y; } let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]; //an initial array let runningTotal = 0; //an accumulated aggregate for(let i=0; i&lt;numbers.length; i++){ runningTotal = add(runningTotal, numbers[i]); } console.log(runningTotal); //15 This loop reduces the array into an “accumulated” sum of all the numbers in the list. Inside the loop, the add() function is called and passed the “current total” and the “new value” to be combined into the aggregate (in that order). The resulting total is then reassigned as the “current total” for the next iteration. The built-in array method reduce() does exactly this work: it takes as an argument a callback function used to combine the current running total with the new value, and returns the aggregated total. Whereas the map() and filter() callback functions each usually took 1 argument (with 2 others optional), the reduce() callback function requires 2 arguments (with 2 others optional): the first will be the “running total” (called the accumulator), and the second will be the “new value” to mix into the aggregate. (While this ordering doesn’t influence the summation example, it is relevant for other operations): function add(x, y) { //a function that adds two numbers return x+y; } let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]; //an initial array let sum = numbers.reduce(add); console.log(sum); //15 The reduce() function (not the callback, but reduce() itself) has a second optional argument after the callback function representing the initial starting value of the reduction. For example, if we wanted our summation function to start with 10 instead of 0, we’d use: //sum starting from 10 let sum = numbers.reduce(add, 10); Note that the syntax can be a little hard to parse if you use an anonymous callback function: //sum starting from 10 numbers.reduce(function(x, y){ return x+y; }, 10); //the starting value comes AFTER the callback! The accumulator value can be any type you want! For example, you can have the starting value be an empty object {} instead of a number, and have the accumulator use the current value to “update” that object (which is “accumulating” information). To summarize, the map(), filter(), and reduce() operations work as follows: Map, filter, reduce explained with emoji. Not valid JavaScript syntax. All together, the map, filter, and reduce operations form the basic platform for a functional consideration of a program. Indeed, these kinds of operations are very common when discussing data manipulations: for example, the famous MapReduce model involves “mapping” each element through a complex function (on a different computer no less!), and then “reducing” the results into a single answer. 11.5 Pure Functions This section was adapted from a tutorial by Dave Stearns. The concept of first-class functions (functions are values) is central to any functional programming language. However, there is more to the functional programming paradigm than just callback functions. In a fully functional programming language, you construct programs by combining small, reusable, pure functions that take in some inputted data, transform it, and then return that data for future use. Pure functions have the following qualities: They operate only on their inputs, and make no reference to other data (e.g., variables at a higher scope such as globals) They never modify their inputs—instead, they always return new data or a reference to an unmodified input They have no side effects outside of their outputs (e.g., they never modify variables at a higher scope) Because of these previous rules, they always return the same outputs for the same inputs A functional program sends its initial input state through a series of these pure functions, much like a plumbing system sends water through a series of pipes, filters, valves, splitters, heaters, coolers, and pumps. The output of the “final” function in this chain becomes the program’s output. Pure functions are almost always easier to test and reason about. Since they have no side-effects, you can simply test all possible classes of inputs and verify that you get the correct outputs. If all of your pure functions are well-tested, you can then combine them together to create highly-predictable and reliable programs. Functional programs can also be easier to read and reason about because they end up looking highly declarative: it reads as a series of data transformations (e.g., take the data, then filter it, then transform it, then sort it, then print it), with the output of each function becoming the input to the next. Although some functional programming zealots would argue that all programs should be written in a functional style, it’s better to think of functional programming as another tool in your toolbox that is appropriate for some jobs, and not so much for others. Object-oriented programming is often the better choice for long-running, highly-interactive client programs, while functional is a better choice for short-lived programs or systems that handle discrete transactions (like many web applications). It’s also possible to combine the two styles: for example, React components can be either object-oriented or functional, and you often use some functional techniques within object-oriented components. Indeed, the latest versions of Java—a highly object-oriented language—add support for functional programming! If you are interested in doing more serious functional programming in JavaScript, there are a large number of additional libraries that can help support that: Lodash (and it’s more pure variant lodash/fp) Ramda Lazy.js There are also many languages that were designed to be functional from the get-go, but can be compiled down into JavaScript to run on web browsers. These include Clojure (via ClojureScript) and Elm. Resources Functional Programming in JavaScript a fantastic interactive tutorial for learning functional programming in JS Higher Order Functions a chapter from the online textbook Eloquent JavaScript Scope &amp; Closures an online textbook with an extremely detailed explanation of scoping in JavaScript "],["dom.html", "Chapter 12 Document Object Model (DOM) 12.1 The DOM API 12.2 DOM Manipulation 12.3 Listening for Events Resources", " Chapter 12 Document Object Model (DOM) The primary purpose of using JavaScript in a web page is to make that page interactive: the JavaScript language is used to program logical decisions that will effect what is shown on the page. It does this primarily by changing the HTML rendered by the browser. For example, JavaScript can be used to change the text inside a &lt;p&gt;, add addition &lt;li&gt; elements to a list, or to give a &lt;div&gt; a new CSS class attribute. The programmatic representation of the HTML elements currently being shown by the browser is known as the Document Object Model (DOM). In web programming JavaScript code is used to modify the DOM (HTML elements currently being shown by the browser) in response to user input, thereby making the page interactive. This chapter introduces the Document Object Model and how to use JavaScript to manipulate it through user-driven interaction. 12.1 The DOM API As you should recall from Chapter 3, HTML elements can be nested, allowing us to consider a webpage as a “tree” of elements: An example DOM tree (a tree of HTML elements). A tree is a hierarchical data structure, where each element (called a node) contains references to child elements. Following the arboreal metaphor, the “start” of the tree is called the root note, hierarchical sequences of nodes are called branches, and a node that does not have any children is called a leaf. Considering a web page’s content to be a tree of HTML elements is one way to model (represent) the structure of that information. This particular model of a web document (as a tree of object nodes) is called the Document Object Model, or DOM for short. In many ways the DOM is the HTML (though the HTML rendered in the browser, not the .html source code you’ve written)! Thus we can refer to the web page’s content as “the DOM”, and an HTML element as a “DOM element”. Note that even “plain text” content (e.g., what is inside a &lt;p&gt; tag) are considered nodes in the DOM tree—they are “text content” nodes (instead of “element nodes”). Moreover, the DOM also provides an Application Programming Interface (API) which allows computer applications to programmatically (e.g., through JavaScript code) interact with it: accessing and manipulating the tree of elements. As you may recall from previous courses, an API is often a set of functions and variables that can be used give instructions to a program. The DOM API is no different: it is a group of functions you can call and variables (usually Object properties) you can adjust to change the rendered web content. You write code to call these functions in order to make a page interactive. Global Variables You can programmatically access the API in JavaScript by utilizing a set of global variables. Global variables are variables that are “globally” scoped: they are available anywhere in the program (not just within a particular function). An important programming style rule is to minimize the use of global variables. Try to avoid creating too many new globals yourself! Global variables in JavaScript are almost always Objects that have methods as their values. For example, the JavaScript language itself provides a global Math object that has includes a number of function properties (e.g., sqrt(), floor(), etc.). console.log( typeof Math ); //=> 'object' console.log( typeof Math.sqrt ); //=> 'function' console.log( Math.sqrt(25) ); //=> 5 In fact, the console object is another global variable provided by the JavaScript runtime (whether inside the browser or inside Node.js)! The web browser also provides a number of global variables that you can use. For example window is a global object that represents the browser itself. You can use this object to get information about the browser: /* example properties */ let width = window.innerWidth; //viewport width let height = window.innerHeight; //viewport height var url = window.location.href; //url for this page /* example functions */ window.alert(\"Boo!\"); //show a popup alert. Do not use this. window.scrollTo(0, 1000); //scroll to a position window.setTimeout(callback, 1000); //execute callback after an delay window.setInterval(callback, 1000); //execute callback repeatedly after interval While these examples are included for completeness, most window functions are rarely used and should be avoided. Popups with the window.alert() function are inelegant, interrupt the user’s actions, and produce a bad user experience—you should instead use in-window alerting options instead (such as showing a &lt;p class=\"alert\"&gt;). Browser control functions such as scrollTo() are non-standard and can vary drastically across systems and platforms. Proceed with caution when using window functions! 12.2 DOM Manipulation While window represents the Browser, the DOM itself is represented by the document global object—document is the DOM (the current HTML rendered in the browser). You access properties and call methods of this object in order to manipulate the content displayed in the browser! Referencing HTML Elements In order to manipulate the DOM elements in a page, you first need to get a reference to the element you want to change—that is, you need a variable that refers to that element. You can get these variable references by using one of the document “selector” functions: //element with id=\"foo\" let fooElem = document.getElementById('foo'); //elements with class=\"row\" let rowElems = document.getElementsByClassName('row'); //note the plural! //&lt;li> elements let liElems = document.getElementsByTagName('li'); //note the plural! /*easiest to select by reusing CSS selectors! */ let cssSelector = 'header p, .title > p'; //a string of a CSS selector //selects FIRST element that matches css selector let elem = document.querySelector(cssSelector); //matches ALL elements that match css selector let elems = document.querySelectorAll(cssSelector); The document.querySelector() is by far the most flexible and easy to use of these methods: it can easily do the same as all the other methods (just put in an id, class, or element selector). You should always use querySelector(). Note that the methods that return multiple nodes (e.g., querySelectorAll) return a NodeList object. While this is like an array (you can access elements via index through bracket notation and it has a .length property), it is not an array: meaning it doesn’t support methods like forEach() and map() across all browsers. If you need to iterate through a NodeList, you should use a regular for loop. But in practice, you’re much more likely to only work with single elements at a time. Modifying HTML Elements Once you have a reference to an element, you access properties and call methods on that object in order to modify its state in the DOM—which will in turn modify how it currently is displayed on the page. Thus by modifying these objects, you are dynamically changing the web page’s content! Important: setting these properties do not change the .html source code file! Instead, they just change the rendered DOM elements (think: the content stored in the computer’s memory rather than in a file). If you refresh the page, the content will go back to how the .html source code file specifies it should appear—unless that also loads the script that modifies the DOM. What is shown on the page is the HTML with the JavaScript modifications added in. Changing Content You can use JavaScript to access and modify the content of a DOM element (e.g., the stuff between the start and close tags): //get a reference to the FIRST &lt;p> element let elem = document.querySelector('p'); console.log(elem); //to demonstrate let text = elem.textContent; //the text content of the elem elem.textContent = \"This is different content!\"; //change the content let html = elem.innerHTML; //content including HTML elem.innerHTML = \"This is &lt;em>different&lt;/em> content!\"; //interpreted as HTML The textContent property of the element refers to all of the content, but considered as “plain text” this means that it is considered a “safe” property: you can assign strings that contain’s HTML code (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt;), but that code will be escaped and not interpreted as HTML (instead the &lt; and &gt; will be written out as if you had used HTML entities). The .innerHTML property, on the other hand, is “not safe”: any HTML included in the String you assign to it will be converted into DOM elements. This makes it not a great property to use unless unless you are absolutely certain the content came from a trusted source. The innerHTML property should be used primarily for including inline elements such as &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;. For more complex HTML content, it is cleaner code (separation of concerns!) to explicitly create new elements—see below for details. You can “clear” the content of an element by setting it’s content to be an empty string (''): let alertElem = document.querySelector('.alert'); alertElem.textContent = ''; //no more alert! Changing Attributes You can also change the attributes of individual elements. Each attribute defined in the HTML specification is typically exposed as a property of the element object: //get a reference to the `#picture` element let imgElem = document.querySelector('#picture'); //access the attribute console.log( imgElem.src ); //logs the source of the image //modify the attribute imgElem.src = 'my-picture.png'; You cannot access element.class or element.style attributes directly in this way; see below for specifics on changing the CSS of an element. You can alternatively modify element attributes by using the methods getAttribute() (passing it which attribute to access) and setAttribute() (passing it which attribute to modify and what value to assign to that attribute): let imgElem = document.querySelector('#picture'); imgElement.setAttribute('src', 'my-other-picture.png'); //set the src console.log( imgElem.getAttribute('src') ); //=> 'my-other-picture.png' //the `hasAttribute()` method returns a boolean. let isThick = document.querySelector('svg rect') .hasAttribute('stroke-width'); //chained anonymous variables These methods will let you interact with attributes that are not defined by the HTML spec, such as data- attribute. However, they don’t work with certain element attributes (such as the value attribute of an &lt;input&gt; element). Other elements may have their own special DOM properties: see the DOM Documentation for a list of HTML interfaces. 12.2.0.1 Changing Element CSS It is possible to modify the CSS classes (and even inline styling) of an element. But rather than using the class property like with other attributes, you instead access the className property. On modern browsers (IE 10 or later), this property supports methods .add() and .remove() for adding and removing classes from the list: //access list of classes let classList = elem.classList; //add a class elem.classList.add('small'); //add a single class elem.classList.add('alert','alert-warning'); //add multiples classes (not on IE) //remove a class elem.classList.remove('small'); //\"toggle\" (add if missing, remove if present) elem.classList.toggle('small'); While IE 10+ does support these methods, it doesn’t support multiple arguments for them (so you can’t add multiple classes in a single method call). If you need to support older browsers (including any version of IE), you can instead modify the .className property as if it were a String: //fallback for IE (all) var classes = elem.className; classes += ' '+ 'sweet sour'; //modify the string (append!) elem.className = classes; //reassign The classList methods work perfectly on Microsoft Edge. It is also possible to access and modify individual CSS properties of elements through the DOM element’s style property. .style references an Object whose keys are the CSS property names (but written in camelCase instead of kabob-case) let h1 = document.querySelector('h1'); h1.style.color = 'green'; h1.style.backgroundColor = 'black'; //not `.background-color` In general, you should modify element CSS by changing the class of the element, rather than specific style properties. Modifying the DOM Tree In addition to modifying the individual DOM elements, it is also possible to access and modify the DOM tree itself! That is, you can create new elements and add them to the tree (read: webpage), remove elements from the tree, or pluck them out of the tree and insert them somewhere else! First, note that each JavaScript DOM element has read-only properties referring to its parent, children, and sibling elements: &lt;main> &lt;section id=\"first-section\"> &lt;p>First paragraph&lt;/p> &lt;p>Second paragraph&lt;/p> &lt;/section> &lt;section id=\"second-section\">&lt;/section> &lt;main> //get reference to the first section let firstSection = document.querySelector('#first-section'); //get reference to the \"parent\" node let main = firstSection.parentElement; console.log(main); //&lt;main>...&lt;/main> //get reference to the child elements (2 paragraphs) let paragraphs = firstSection.children; console.log(paragraphs.length); //2 console.log(paragraphs[0]); //&lt;p>First paragraph&lt;/p> //get reference to the the next sibling let sectionSection = firstSection.nextElementSibling; console.log(secondSection); //&lt;section id=\"second-section\">&lt;/section> Note that these properties only deal with HTML elements—text content nodes are ignored. You can instead use equivalent properties parentNode and childNodes to also consider text content nodes. SVG content doesn’t support parentElement, but does support parentNode. You can also call methods to create and add new HTML DOM elements to the tree. The document.createElement() function is used to create a new HTML element. However this element is not created a part of the tree (after all, you haven’t specified where it would put into the page)! Thus you need to also use a method such as appendChild to add that new element as a child of another element: //create a new &lt;p> (not yet in the tree) let newP = document.createElement('p'); newP.textContent = \"I'm new!\"; //create Node of textContent only (not an HTML element, just text) let newText = document.createTextNode(\"I'm blank\"); let main = document.querySelector('main'); main.appendChild(newP); //add element INSIDE (at end) main.appendChild(newText); //add the text inside, AFTER the &lt;p> //add anonymous new node BEFORE element. Parameters are: (new, old) main.insertBefore(document.createTextNode(\"First!\"), newP); //replace node. Parameters are: (new, old) main.replaceChild(document.createTextNode('boo'), newText); //remove node main.removeChild(main.querySelector('p')); The appendChild() method is considered a cleaner approach than just modifying the innerHTML property, as it allows you to adjust the DOM tree without erasing what was previously there. A common practice is to use document.createElement() to create a block element, then set the innerHTML of that element to its content (which can include inline elements), and then use appendChild to add the new block element to the tree at the desired location. Accessibility Whenever you learn a new technology, you should ask: how does this affect accessibility? With the JavaScript code modifying the rendered DOM, it is possible that the content of a page will change after it has been read by a screen reader. And while a sighted user will likely be able to see the change visually, a screen reader has no way of knowing that something on the page is different unless you tell it. You can let screen readers know that an element in a page may have its content change in the future by making that element into an ARIA Live Region. Live regions are “watched” by assistive technologies, and whenever the content changes they will speak the new content to the reader as if it were being read for the first time. You make an element into a live region by giving it the aria-live attribute: &lt;div aria-live=\"polite\"> This content can change! &lt;/div> The value assigned to the aria-live attribute is the “politeness level”, which specifies the priority by which the screen reader should read the change. The most common option (that you should almost always use) is \"polite\", which indicates that the changed text will be read only once the user has paused whatever is currently being read. A \"polite\" alert doesn’t interrupt the currently being read text or description, but instead will be injected when there is a break (if the current reading goes on for too long, then the new content will not be spoken). The other option is \"assertive\", which indicates that the new content should be spoken as soon as it changes, possibly interrupting other content. This should only be used for important information (like alerts, warnings, or errors), as it can interrupt the user’s flow in ways that are very disorienting. In short: always be polite! 12.3 Listening for Events In order to make a page interactive (that is, able to change in response to user actions), you need to be able to respond to user events. Whenever a user interacts with a computer, the operating system announces that interaction as an event—the event of a button being clicked, the event of the mouse being moved, the event of a keyboard key being pressed, etc. These events are broadcast to the entire system, allowing any application (including the browser) to “respond” the occurrence of the event, such as by executing a particular JavaScript function. Thus in order to respond to user actions (and the events those actions generate), we need to define a function that will be executed when the event occurs. You will define a function as normal, but the function will not get called by you as a particular step in your script. Instead, the function you specify will be executed by the system when an event occurs, which will be at some indeterminate time in the future. This process is known as event-driven programming. It is also an example of asynchronous programming: in which statements are not executed in a single order one after another (“synchronously”), but may occur “out of order” or even at the same time! (For more about working with asynchronous programming, see Chapter 14). In order for your script to respond to user events, you need to register an event listener. This is a bit like following someone on social media: you specify that you want to “listen” for updates from that person, as well as what you want to do when you “hear” some news from that person. Specifying that you want Slack to notify you when your name is mentioned is another good analogy! The DOM API allows you to register an event listener by call the .addEventListener() on a selected element (e.g., on the element that you want to listen to). This method takes two arguments: a string representing what kind of event you want to listen for, and a callback function to execute when you hear that event: //a (named) callback function function onClickCallback() { console.log(\"You clicked me!\"); } //get a reference to the element we want to \"listen\" to let button = document.querySelector('button'); //register a listener for 'click' events button.addEventListener('click', onClickCallback); When the button is clicked by the user, it will “shout” out a 'click' event (“I was clicked! I was clicked!”). Because you have set up a listener (an alert/notification) for such an occurrence, your script will be able to do something—and that something that it will do is run the specified callback function. It’s like you handed someone a recipe and told them “when I call you, bake this cake!” It is much more common to use an anonymous function as the callback: let button = document.querySelect.select('button'); button.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log(\"You clicked me!\"); }); Note that this listener only applies to that particular button—if you wanted to respond to a different button, you’d need to register a separate listener! Also, as the method name implies, it is possible to add multiple listeners (callbacks) to the same element for the same event: all of them will be executed “at once”. The event callback will be passed in a single argument: an object representing the “event” that occurred. (Since all parameters are optional in JavaScript, and it wasn’t used in the above example, it wasn’t included in the callback definition). This event includes information such as where the event occurred (in x,y coordinates), what DOM element caused the event, and more: elem.addEventListener('click', function(event) { //get who was clicked; let clickedElem = event.target; //target property of the event console.log(clickedElem); }); Also note that sometimes you want to stop the “normal” results of an event from occurring. For example, perhaps you don’t want a button to do it’s normal button thing (such as submitting a form), and instead want to provide your own custom behavior. To support this, you can “interrupt the event” by calling the following methods on the event: submitBtn.addEventListener('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); //don't do normal behavior event.stopPropagation(); //don't pass the event to parents //..do custom behavior here return false; //don't do normal behavior OR propagate! (for IE) }) Types of Events There are numerous different events that you can listen for, including: Mouse Events such as 'click'. The event.offsetX and event.offsetY will provide (x,y) coordinates for the clicks location relative to the target element; you can use clientX/Y for coordinates relative to the browser window, or pageX/Y for coordinates relative to the document (regardless of scrolling). See this post for details, and this page for an example. Other mouse events include 'dblclick' (double-click), 'mousedown' (mouse button is pressed down, may be held), 'hover' (mouse hover), 'mouseenter' (mouse moves over element), 'mousemove' (mouse moves over element), and 'mouseleave' (mouse moves of of element). Keyboard Events such as 'keydown'. The event.key property is used to determine which key was pressed, giving a predefined key value you can check: elem.addEventListener('keydown', function(event){ if(event.key === 'ArrowUp'){ console.log(\"Going up!\") } //... }); The event object also has properties to check if any “modifier keys” such as shift, control, or meta (Windows/command) are held when the event occurs. Note that you almost always want to respond to the 'keydown' and 'keyup' events; the 'keypressed' event is sent later and only applies to non-modifier keys. Window Events are event created by the window global, which we are also able to register event listeners on! For example, the 'resize' event can be used to identify when the window has changed size (e.g., if you want to make the content responsive as well as the CSS): window.addEventListener(\"resize\", function() { //... }); (See the documentation for advise on using this callback) Additionally, the window global defines a special event callback that occurs when the web page has finished loading. You can assign your own function to this callback to run code only after the webpage has loaded (e.g., for scripts specified in the &lt;head&gt;): window.onload = function() { //...do stuff once page is ready (e.g., run the rest of your code) } Style guideline: always register event listeners in the JavaScript—do not utilize the HTML attributes such as onclick. This is to help keep concerns separated: the HTML should not need to know anything about the JavaScript that is utilized (since the browser may not even support JavaScript!), but it’s okay for the JavaScript to rely on and modify the HTML. Event-Driven Programming In a typical web program event callback functions can occur repeatedly, over and over again (e.g., every time the user clicks a button). This makes them potentially act a bit like the body of a while loop. However, because these callbacks are functions, any variables defined within them are scoped to that function, and will not be available on subsequent executions. Thus if you want to keep track of some additional information (e.g., how many times the button was clicked), you will need to use a variable declared outside of the function (e.g., a global ). Such variables can be used to represent the state (situation) of the program, which can then be used to determine what behavior to perform when an event occurs, following the below pattern: //pseudocode WHEN an event occurs { check the STATE of the program; DECIDE what to do based on that state; UPDATE the state as necessary for the next event; } For example: let clickCount = 0; //keep track of the \"state\" (global) document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() { if(clickCount > 10) { //decide what to do console.log(\"I think you've had enough\"); } else { clickCount++; //change state (+1) console.log('You clicked me!'); } }); These “state” variables can be global, or can simply be declared within a containing function as a closure. State variables are often objects, with individual values stored as the properties. This provides a name-spacing feature, and helps to keep the code from being cluttered with many variables. Resources What is the DOM? (CSS-Tricks) Document Object Model reference (MDN) complete DOM reference JavaScript HTML DOM reference (w3c) Introduction to Events (MDN) "],["javascript-libraries.html", "Chapter 13 JavaScript Libraries 13.1 Including a Library 13.2 Example: jQuery Resources", " Chapter 13 JavaScript Libraries Many web programmers encounter the same programming requirements as they develop interactive web sites. For example, many websites will need to wrangle and manipulate objects and arrays, show standard components (such as modal windows or collapsible content), or do similar forms of complex DOM manipulation. Since one of the main principles of software development is reuse, developers will often make the code solving these problems available for others to use in the form of libraries and frameworks. These are publicly release script files that you can download and include in your project, allowing you to more quickly and easily develop complex applications. This is the amazing thing about the open-source community: people solve problems and then make those solutions available to others. Modern web applications make extensive use of external libraries, whether by integrating many different libraries into a single app, or by relying on a particular framework (which may itself be comprised of many different libraries)! This chapter describes how to include and utilize external JavaScript libraries in your web page, and presents the popular jQuery library as an example. For a sense of scale, the npm package manager’s directory lists almost half a million different JavaScript libraries! Note that external scripts are generally referred to as either libraries or frameworks. However, these terms are not entirely interchangeable. A library is a set of behaviors (functions) that you are able to utilize and call within your code. For example, Lodash (described below) is a library that provides utility functions you can use. You call a library’s code at your whim. A framework, on the other hand, provides a set of code into which you insert your own behaviors, either by subclassing provided components or by specifying your own callback functions. The framework calls your code at its whim. Martin Fowler refers to this as an “Inversion of control”. Frameworks often seem to be easier to use (they do more with less work on your part!), but can be hard to customize to achieve your exact goals. Libraries may be harder to use, but can likely be deployed exactly as needed. This chapter focuses mainly on libraries; React (detailed in later chapters) is more of a framework. 13.1 Including a Library Just like you can include multiple CSS files in a page with multiple &lt;link&gt; elements, you can include multiple JavaScript scripts with multiple &lt;script&gt; elements. &lt;script src=\"alpha.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;!-- run this script first --> &lt;script src=\"beta.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;!-- run this script second --> Importantly, script files are executed in the order in which they appear in the DOM. This matters because all scripts included via the &lt;script&gt; element are all run within the same namespace. This means variables and functions declared in one script file are also available in later scripts— it’s almost as if all the script files have been combined into a single file. /* alpha.js */ let message = \"Hello World\"; /* beta.js */ console.log(message); //=> \"Hello World\" //variable was defined in previous script! The order matters: if beta.js were included before alpha.js, then when it is run the message variable won’t have been defined yet, causing an error. Other techniques for managing and organizing large numbers of script files will be discussed in Chapter 15. Like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries are thus included in a page by providing a &lt;script&gt; tag that references the JavaScript file that contains that library’s code. For example, you can include the Lodash of helpful data processing functions: &lt;body> ...content &lt;!-- include JavaScript files --> &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.4/lodash.min.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;script src=\"js/my-script.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;/body> Like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries can be accessed by referencing the file on a CDN, by downloading the source code directly (check for the .js file; you may need to unpack a .zip file), or by installing the library via a package manager like npm. Refer to Chapter 3 for details—just change .css to .js! Like CSS, JavaScript files can be minimized (usually named as .min.js files). Minimizing JavaScript files not only removes whitespace, but also often replaces local variable names with shorter, meaningless ones such as a or x. You always want to load external libraries before your script, so that any variables and functions they define will be available to your code! If you put your script first, then those functions won’t be available yet! Because all JavaScript files share the same namespace, most popular libraries make all of their functions available as properties of a single global variable. For example, Lodash provides a global variable called _ (a single underscore—a “low dash”). You use this variable to call the provided functions: let array = [3,4,3]; let unique = _.uniq(array); //call function of lodash object console.log(unique); //[3,4], the unique elements! Once the library is loaded, the globals it provide can be accessed just like built-in globals window, document, Math, etc. Lodash uses an otherwise silly variable name so that it’s quick and easy to type, and to avoid conflicts with other variables you might create. Lodash provides lots of useful functions that can be called on the global _ object. For example: _.random() to generate a random number within a range _.range() to generate an array of numbers within a range _.includes() to determine if a value is in an array (cross-browser!) _.pick() to produce a new object that has only select properties of another _.merge() to combine the properties of two objects into a single new object Note that exactly what global object is provided (and what functions it has) is different for every different library. You need to look through the documentation (often the README.md file on Github) for instructions and examples on how to call and utilize that library. “Knowing” a library or framework is just about being familiar with what functions you can call from it! Pro-tip: Visual Studio Code will automatically download the type definitions for any library listed as a dependency in the project’s package.json. For example, if you include Lodash as a dependency (by installing it with npm install --save lodash), then just typing the _. will cause VS Code to provide autocomplete options. This makes it a good idea to install JavaScript libraries via npm, even if you plan on loading the library from a CDN instead of from a local file. If you’re using something a linter to check your coding style, you’ll need to let the linter know about any global variables loaded in other scripts so that the linter doesn’t think those variables are undefined. See the documentation for details about how to do this in ESLint. 13.2 Example: jQuery As an extended example of a JavaScript library, the remainder of this chapter describes jQuery—a popular JavaScript library that helps with DOM manipulation. jQuery was designed to provide easier, faster, and more reliable methods for manipulating the DOM in the ways described in the previous chapter. jQuery is one of the most popular libraries used in web development, and is used in around 70% of the most popular websites. jQuery was developed to help fill in gaps in the JavaScript language and to standardize functionality across browsers. It made it so that you could write manipulate the DOM while writing 10% of the code, and produce scripts that would run on both Firefox and Internet Explorer! However, in the 10+ years since it’s release, later versions of the JavaScript language and the DOM API have improved (e.g., by introducing a querySelector() function) so that much of what made jQuery special is now standard and widely supported. Indeed, jQuery’ approach to interactive webpages is now common practice. Nevertheless, jQuery is still commonly used in web systems (Bootstrap’s JavaScript components utilize jQuery), and is popular enough that it you should be familiar with it in the likely chance that you need to engage with a web system build more than 3 years ago. As with other libraries, you include jQuery by referencing it from a &lt;script&gt; tag in your HTML (before your own script!): &lt;script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\">&lt;/script> Note that version jQuery 3.x is for current browsers. If you need to support an older version (e.g., IE 6-8), you can use version 1.12. Yes, jQuery supports IE 6! Loading the jQuery library creates a jQuery variable in the global scope, meaning you can access this variable and utilize it in your script. The jQuery variable is actually a function that you can call, called the Selector function. This function is used to select DOM elements by CSS selector, similar to how document.querySelector() works: //selects element with id=\"foo\" (e.g., &lt;p id=\"foo\">) let fooElem = jQuery('#foo'); //selects all &lt;a> elements let allLinksArray = jQuery('a'); However, it is much more common to use a provided alias for the jQuery() function called $(). This “shortcut” lets you select elements with a single character (instead of 6)! //selects element with id=\"foo\" (e.g., &lt;p id=\"foo\">) let fooElem = $('#foo'); //selects all &lt;a> elements let allLinksArray = $('a'); Similar to Lodash’s _, jQuery uses $ because no one in their right might would name a variable that, so the chance of having a namespace conflict is minimal. Like document.querySelector(), the jQuery selector function handles most all selectors you are familiar with from CSS, as well as some additional useful pseudo-classes: $('#my-div') // by id $('div') // by type $('.my-class') // by class $('header, footer') // group selector $('nav a') // descendant selector $('p.red') // scoped selector $('section:first') // first &lt;section> element // (not a css selector!) Maniputing the DOM Once you’ve selected some elements, jQuery provides methods that perform most of the manipulations you would do using DOM properties: var txt = $('#my-div').text(); //get the textContent $('#my-div').text('new info!'); //change the textContent $('#my-div').html('&lt;em>new html!&lt;/em>'); //change the HTML $('svg rect').attr('height'); //get attribute (of all selected) $('svg rect').attr('height',200); //set attribute (of all selected) $('svg rect').attr( {x:50, y:60} ); //set multiple attributes by passing in an object $('section').addClass('container'); //add class (to all selected) $('section').removeClass('old'); //remove class (from all selected) $('body').css('font-size','24px'); //set css property (of all selected) $('body').css( {'font-size':'24px', 'font-family':'Helvetica'} ); //set multiple properties via an object If you compare this to the equivalent operations using the DOM, you’ll notice that (a) jQuery is much more concise. jQuery is also more powerful: for example, you can set multiple attributes with a single call to .attr() by passing in an object containing the attributes you wish to set (the keys are the attribute names). This lets you easily change lots of attributes at once! Importantly, note that all of these methods apply the change to all elements selected by the jQuery selector function. You do not need to use a loop to apply changes to multiple elements; you can just select the elements you wish to modify and change them all at once. This does mean that you may need to be careful about your selector—only select the elements you actually wish to work with! jQuery also provides methods that allow you to manipulate the DOM tree (e.g., to add, move, or remove elements): //create an element (not yet in the DOM) let newP = $('&lt;p class=\"new\">This is a new element&lt;/p>'); //notice the tag! //add content to DOM $('main').append(newP); //add the element INSIDE &lt;main>, at end $('main').append('&lt;em>new&lt;/em>'); //can a create element on the fly! $('main').prepend('&lt;em>new&lt;/em>'); //add new &lt;em> element INSIDE &lt;main>, at beginning $('main').before('&lt;header>'); //insert new &lt;header> BEFORE &lt;main> (older sibling) //notice you can omit the closing tag if no content $('footer').insertAfter('main'); //insert selected (&lt;footer>) AFTER parameter (&lt;main>) //since the &lt;footer> was selected, it will move! $('main').wrap('&lt;div class=\"container\">&lt;/div>'); //surround the &lt;main> with a .container $('footer').remove(); //remove selected &lt;footer> element $('main').empty(); //remove all child elements of &lt;main> The first important thing to note is that you create new elements by provided the HTML content (including the tag &lt;&gt;) to the $() function. This is distinct from document.createElement(), which explicitly does not include the &lt;&gt; angle brackets. If creating an element with no content, you can even just specify the start tag! jQuery also provides much more powerful manipulation methods, allowing you to easily position elements inside, outside, around, and in place of other elements. Although jQuery will allow you to create arbitrarily complex HTML elements to add to the DOM, you should avoid writing large chunks of HTML inside your .js file to append via jQuery (e.g., don’t add an entire DOM tree at once!). This violates the separation of concerns, and makes your code difficult to read, interpret, and modify (because your HTML is now in two places!). If you do need to dynamically insert large amounts of “hard-coded” HTML, you should instead write that content inside the .html file, make it invisible (e.g., display:none), and then use jQuery to move and show the element when needed. Handling Events jQuery also provides convenience methods for registering event listeners: $('#button').click(function(event) { console.log('clicky clicky!'); //who was clicked let element = $(event.target); }); There are equivalent methods for other events: .mousedown() .keypress(), etc. If you want to listen for an event that jQuery doesn’t provide a convenience method for, you can use the .on() function: $('#search-input').on('input', callback); By using a method such as .click(callback) rather than .addEventListener('click', callback) or event .on('click', callback), you avoid potential hard-to-catch bugs that may get introduced from misspelling 'click'—rather than having the browser listen for 'clik' events and then never seeming to respond to your actions, it will instead report an error (.clik() is not a known function!) The event parameter passed into the .click() function’s callback is exactly like the event passed to callbacks of addEventListener() (though jQuery standardizes cross-browser quirks)—thus you can access the source of the event with the event.target property. However, this property refers to a DOM element, not a jQuery selector. DOM elements don’t support the jQuery methods described above—those are only available to “jQuery selection objects”. Thus if you want to work with a DOM element, you need to “select” it again using the $() function, thus providing a jQuery selection that has all the useful jQuery methods. Additionally, jQuery assigns the this variable inside an event callback to the event’s target; this you can equivalently use $(this) to select the element. The previous chapter noted the window.onload even listener, which was used to determine when the DOM had finished loading and so was ready to be manipulated. jQuery provides a similar functionality via the .ready() listener (usually called on the whole document): $(document).ready(function() { //this need not be an anonymous function //program goes here console.log('Hello world!'); //... }); This is a very common pattern: often with jQuery entire programs will be specified inside the .ready() callback, so that the &lt;script&gt; tags can be placed in the &lt;head&gt; and downloaded quickly but still run only when the DOM is available. This pattern is so common in fact, that the jQuery selector function can serve as a shortcut to it: //equivalent to the above $(function() { //program goes here console.log('Hello world!'); //... }); If you pass a function rather than a Selector string to the $() jQuery function, it will be interpreted as specifying a callback function to run when the document is ready! This is something to be aware of if you look at someone else’s code and see it just start with a random $(function). And more! This is only the tip of the iceberg for what jQuery can do. For example, jQuery also provides a number of utility functions that can be called on the jQuery (or $) global: //check if an item is in an array $.inArray(4, [3,4,3] ); jQuery.inArray(4, [3,4,3] ); //equivalent, but maybe easier to read //find an item in an array that matches the filter function //this is like .filter, but works on old browsers (if right jQuery version) $.grep( [3,4,3], function(item) { return item > 3; }); //iterate over arrays or objects -- works for either! $.each( [3,4,3], function(key, value) { console.log('Give me a '+value); }); $.each( {first:'Joel',last:'Ross'}, function(key, value) { console.log(key+' name: '+value); }); This can be useful, though JavaScript native functions or Lodash methods will often be easier and (computationally) faster. But as a final fun example: jQuery also provides functions that allow you to easily produce animated effects! $('#id').fadeIn(1000); //fade in over 1 second $('#id').fadeOut(500); //fade out over 1/2 sec $('#id').slideDown(200); //slide down over 200ms $('#id').slideUp(500); //slide up over 500ms $('#id').toggle(); //toggle whether displayed //custom animation syntax: //$(selector).animate({targetProperties}, speed [, doneCallback]); $(\"#box\").animate({ left: '500px', //make the box fly around! opacity: '0.5', height: '200px', width: '200px' }, 1500); Resources Lodash Documentation jQuery Documentation jQuery Learning Center jQuery Tutorial (w3c) "],["es6.html", "Chapter 14 ES6+ Features 14.1 Classes 14.2 Arrow Functions 14.3 Destructuring and Spreading 14.4 Modules 14.5 Other Features Resources", " Chapter 14 ES6+ Features As discussed in Chapter 10, the ECMAScript specification for the JavaScript language has gone through several different versions, each of which adds new syntax and features to try and make the language more powerful or easier to work with. In 2015, a new version of the language was released—officially called “ECMAScript 2015”, most developers refer to it by the working name “ES6” (e.g., version 6 of the language). This chapter introduces some of the most notable and useful features introduced in ES6 and later versions of JavaScript—particularly those that will be utilized by the React framework (discussed in the following chapters). ES6 is mostly supported by modern browsers, with the notable exception of Internet Explorer. However, the JavaScript interpreter in older browsers (and IE) won’t be ale to recognize the new syntax introduced in this version. Instead, you would need to covert that code into equivalent ES5 (or earlier) code, which can be understood. The easiest way to do this is with the Babel compiler, which will “transpile” JavaScript code from one version to another. The next chapter discusses how to perform this transpiling with React (spoiler: it’s automatically performed by provided build tools), but it is also possible to install and utilize the Babel compiler yourself. 14.1 Classes While JavaScript is primarily a scripting and functional language, it does support a form of Object Oriented Programming like that used in the Java language. That is, we are able to define classes of data and methods that act on that data, and then instantiate those classes into objects that can be manipulated. ES6 introduces a new class syntax so that creating classes in JavaScript even looks like how you make classes in Java! Why Classes? The whole point of using classes in programming—whether Java or JavaScript—is to perform abstraction: we want to be able to encapsulate (“group”) together parts of our code so we can talk about it at a higher level. So rather than needing to think about the program purely in terms of Numbers, Strings, and Arrays, we can think about it in terms of Dogs, Cats or Persons. In particular, classes encapsulate two things: The data (variables) that describe the thing. These are known as attributes, fields or instance variables (variables that belong to a particular instance, or example, of the class). For example, we might talk about a Person object’s name (a String), age (a Number), and Halloween haul (an array of candy). The behaviors (functions) that operate on, utilize, or change that data. These are known as methods (technically instance methods, since they operate on a particular instance of the class). For example, a Person may be able to sayHello(), trickOrTreat(), or eatCandy(). In JavaScript, an Object’s properties can be seen as the attributes of that object. For example: let person = { name: 'Ada', age: 21, costume: 'Cheshire Cat' trickOrTreat: function(newCandy){ this.candy.push(newCandy); } } //tell me about this person! console.log(person.name + \" is a \" + person.costume); This Object represents a thing with name, age and costume attributes (but we haven’t yet indicated that this Object has the classification of “Person”). The value of the trickOrTreat() property is a function (remember: functions are values!), and is an example of how an Object can “have” a function. JavaScript even uses the this keyword to refer to which object that function being called on, just like Java! See below for more on the this keyword and its quirks. A Class (classification) acts as template/recipe/blueprint for individual objects. It defines what data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) they have. An object is an “instance of” (example of) a class: we instantiate an object from a class. This lets you easily create multiple objects, each of which can track and modify its own data. ES6 classes provide a syntax by which these “templates” can be defined. React’s preferred styling no longer relies heavily on class syntax, but it’s still a good idea to be familiar with it to help with your understanding and in case you need to do more complex work. Review: Classes in Java First, consider the following simple class defined in Java (which should be review from earlier programming courses): //class declaration public class Person { //attributes (private) private String firstName; private int age; //a Constructor method //this is called when the class is instantiated (with `new`) //and has the job of initializing the attributes public Person(String newName, int newAge){ //assign parameters to the attributes this.firstName = newName; this.age = newAge; } //return this Person's name public String getName() { return this.firstName; //return own attribute } //grow a year public void haveBirthday() { this.age++; //increase this person's age (accessing own attribute) } //a method that takes in a Person type as a parameter public void sayHello(Person otherPerson) { //call method on parameter object for printing System.out.println(\"Hello, \" + otherPerson.getName()); //access own attribute for printing System.out.println(\"I am \" + this.age + \" years old\"); } } You can of course utilize this class (instantiate it and call its methods) as follows: public static void main(String[] args) { //instantiate two new People objects Person aliceObj = new Person(\"Alice\", 21); Person bobObj = new Person(\"Bob\", 42); //call method on Alice (changing her fields) aliceObj.haveBirthday(); //call the method ON Alice, and PASS Bob as a param to it aliceObj.sayHello(bobObj); } A few things to note about this syntax: You declare (announce) that you’re defining a class by using the class keyword. Java attributes are declared at the top of the class block (but assigned in the constructor). Classes have constructor methods that are used to instantiate the attributes. Class methods are declared inside the class declaration (inside the block, indenting one step). Class methods can access (use) the object’s attribute variables by referring to them as this.attributeName. You instantiate objects of the class’s type by using the new keyword and then calling a method with the name of the class (e.g., new Person()). That method is the constructor, so is passed the constructor’s parameters. You call methods on objects by using dot notation (e.g., object.methodName()). Instantiated objects are just variables, and so can be passed into other methods. ES6 Class Syntax Here is how you would create the exact same class in JavaScript using ES6 syntax: //class declaration class Person { //a Constructor method //this is called when the class is instantiated (with `new`) //and has the job of initializing the attributes constructor(newName, newAge) { //assign parameters to the attributes this.firstName = newName; this.age = newAge; } //return this Person's name getName() { return this.firstName; //return own attribute } //grow a year haveBirthday() { this.age++; //increase this person's age (accessing own attribute) } //a method that takes in a Person type as a parameter sayHello(otherPerson) { //call method on parameter object for printing console.log(\"Hello, \" + otherPerson.getName()); //access own attribute for printing console.log(\"I am \" + this.age + \" years old\"); } } And here is how you would use this class: //instantiate two new People objects let aliceObj = new Person(\"Alice\", 21); let bobObj = new Person(\"Bob\", 42); //call method on Alice (changing her attributes) aliceObj.haveBirthday(); //call the method ON Alice, and PASS Bob as a param to it aliceObj.sayHello(bobObj); As you can see, this syntax is very, very similar to Java! Just like with JavaScript functions, most of the changes have involved getting rid of type declarations. In fact, you can write a class in Java and then just delete a few words to make it an ES6 class. Things to notice: Just like in Java, JavaScript classes are declared using the class keyword (this is what was introduced in ES6). Always name classes in PascalCase (starting with an Upper case letter)! JavaScript classes do not declare attributes ahead of time (at the top of the class). Unlike Java, JavaScript variables always “exist”, they’re just undefined until assigned, so you don’t need to explicitly declare them. In JavaScript, nothing is private; you effectively have public access to all attributes and functions. JavaScript classes always have only one constructor (if any), and the function is simply called constructor(). That’s even clearer than Java, where you only know it’s a constructor because it lacks a return type. Just like in Java, JavaScript class methods are declared inside the class declaration (inside the block, indenting one step). But note that you don’t need to use the word function to indicate that a method is a function; just provide the name &amp; parameters. This is because the only things in the class are functions, so declaring it as such would be redundant. Just like in Java, JavaScript class methods can access (use) the object’s attribute variables by referring to them as this.attributeName. Just like in Java, you instantiate objects of the class’s type by using the new keyword and then calling a method with the name of the class (e.g., new Person()). That method is the constructor(), so is passed the constructor’s parameters. Just like in Java, you call methods on objects by using dot notation (e.g., object.methodName()). Just like in Java, instantiated objects are just variables, and so can be passed into other methods. So really, it’s just like Java—except that for the differences in how you declare functions and the fact that we use the word constructor to name the constructor methods. The other difference is that while in Java we usually define each class inside it’s own file, in JavaScript you often create multiple classes in a single file, at the same global “level” as you declared other, non-class functions: //script.js 'use strict'; //declare a class class Dog { bark() { /*...*/ } } //declare another class class Cat { meow() { /*...*/ } } //declare a (non-class) function function petAnimal(animal) { /*...*/ } //at the \"main\" level, instantiate the classes and call the functions let fido = new Dog(); petAnimal(fido); //pass this Dog object to the function Although the above syntax looks like Java, it’s important to remember that JavaScript class instances are still just normal Objects like any other. For example, you can add new properties and functions to that object, or overwrite the value of any property. Although it looks like a Java class, it doesn’t really behave like one. Inheritance The ES6 class syntax also allows you to specify class inheritance, by which one class can extend another. Inheritance allows you to specify that one class is a more specialized version of another: that is, a version of that class with “extra abilities” (such as additional methods). As in Java, you use the extends keyword to indicate that one class should inherit from another: //The \"parent/super\" class class Dog { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } sit() { console.log('The dog '+this.name+' sits. Good boy.'); } bark() { console.log('\"Woof!\"'); } } //The \"child/sub\" class (inherits abilities from Dog) class Husky extends Dog { constructor(name, distance) { super(name); //call parent constructor this.distance = distance; } //a new method (\"special ability\") throwFootball() { console.log('Husky '+this.name+' throws '+this.dist+' yards'); } //override (replace) parent's method bark() { super.bark(); //call parent method console.log(\"(Go huskies!)\"); } } //usage let dog = new Husky(\"Harry\", 60); //make a Husky dog.sit(); //call inherited method dog.throwFootball(); //call own method dog.bark(); //call own (overridden) method In this case, the class Husky is a specialized version of the class Dog: it is a Dog that has a few special abilities (e.g., it can throw a football). We refer to the base, less specialized class (Dog) as the parent or super class, and the derived, more specialized class (Husky) as the child or sub-class. The sub-class Husky class inherits the methods defined in its parent: even though the Husky class didn’t define a sit() method, it still has that method define because the parent has that method defined! By extending an existing class, you get can get a lot of methods for free! The Husky class is also able to override its parents methods, defining it’s own specialized version (e.g., bark()). This is useful for adding customization, or for providing specific implementations of callbacks that may be utilized by a framework—a pattern that you’ll see in React. Note that despite this discussion, JavaScript is not actually an object-oriented language. JavaScript instead uses a prototype system for defining types of Objects, which allows what is called prototypical inheritance. The ES6 class keyword doesn’t change that: instead, it is simply a “shortcut syntax” for specifying Object prototypes in the same way that has been supported since the first version of JavaScript. The class keyword makes it easy to define something that looks and acts like an OOP class, but JavaScript isn’t object-oriented! See this (detailed) explanation for further discussion. 14.2 Arrow Functions As described in Chapter 11, JavaScript lets you define functions as anonymous values: let sayHello = function(name) { return 'Hello '+name; } As you have seen, the use of anonymous functions is incredibly common in JavaScript, particularly when used as anonymous callbacks. Because this is so common, ES6 introduced a simpler, more concise shortcut syntax for quickly specifying anonymous functions. Though officially called lambda functions, they are more commonly known as arrow functions, because of how they utilize an “arrow” symbol =&gt;: let sayHello = (name) => { return 'Hello '+name; } To turn an anonymous function into an arrow function, you just remove the function keyword from the definition, and place an arrow =&gt; between the parameter list and the block (indicating that the parameter list “goes to” the following block). This saves you a couple of characters when typing. And for simple callback functions, you can make this even more compact: If the function takes only a single parameter, you can leave off the () around the parameter list. If the function body has only a single statement, you can leave the {} off the block. If the function body has only a single statement AND that statement returns a value, you can leave off the return keyword (the “single statement” arrow function returns the result of the last statement, which will either be an expression or undefined). Thus the above sayHello method could be written using concise body format as: let sayHello = name => 'Hello '+name; I recommend you always leave the parentheses () on the parameter list, as it helps with readability (and makes it easier to adjust the parameters later)! Note that if a function takes no parameters, you must include the () to indicate it is an arrow function: //normal function syntax let printHello = function() { console.log('Hello world'); } //arrow syntax let printHello = () => { console.log('Hello world'); } //concise body let printHello = () => console.log('Hello world'); Despite the above example, it’s better style to include the {} around a function body that doesn’t return a value. Arrow functions are particularly useful for specifying anonymous callback functions: let array = [1,2,3]; //an array to work with //normal function array.map(function(num) { return num*2; //multiply each item by 2 }); //arrow syntax array.map(num => { return num*2; //multiply each item by 2 }); //concise body array.map(num => num*2); Arrow functions are great and you should always use them for anonymous callback functions (if your target platform suppo them). They have quickly become the standard way of writing JavaScript, and thus you will see them all over examples and professionally written code. Working with this In JavaScript, functions are called on Objects by using dot notation (e.g., myObject.myFunction()). Inside a function, you can refer to the Object that the function was called on by using the this keyword. this is a local variable that is implicitly assigned the Object as a value. let doggy = { name: \"Fido\", bark: function() { console.log(this.name, \"woofs\"); //`this` is object the function was called on } } doggy.bark(); //=> \"Fido woofs\" Here the this is assigned the object doggy, what .bark() was called on. But because functions are values and so can be assigned to multiple variables (given multiple labels), the object that a function is called on may not necessarily be the object that it was first assigned to as a property. this refers to object the function is called on at execution time, not at the time of definition: //An object representing a Dog let doggy = { name: \"Fido\", bark: function() { console.log(this.name + \" woofs\"); } } // An object representing another Dog let doggo = { name: \"Spot\", bark: function() { console.log(this.name + \" yips\")} } //This is Fido barking doggy.bark( /*this = doggy*/ ); //=> \"Fido woofs\" //This is Spot barking doggo.bark( /*this = doggo*/ ); //=> \"Spot yips\" //This is Fido using Spot's bark! doggy.bark = doggo.bark; //assign the function value to `doggy` doggy.bark( /*this = doggy*/) //=> \"Fido yips\" Notice how the this variable is implicitly assigned a value of whatever object it was called on—even the function is assigned to a new object later! But because the this variable refers to the object the function is called on, problems can arise for anonymous callback functions that are not called on any object in particular: class Person { constructor(name){ this.name = name; } //basic constructor //greet each person in the given array greetAll(peopleArray) { //loop through each Person using a callback peopleArray.forEach(function(person) { console.log(\"Hi\"+person.name+\", I'm \"+this.name); }); } } In this example, the greetAll() function will produce an error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined. That is because the this is being called from within an anonymous callback function (the function(person){...})—and that callback isn’t being called on any particular object (notice the lack of dot notation). Since the anonymous callback isn’t being executed on an object, this is assigned a value of undefined (and you can’t access undefined.name). The solution to this problem is to use arrow functions. An arrow function has the special feature that it shares the same lexical this as its surrounded code: that is, the this will not be reassigned to a (non-existent) object when used within an arrow function: class Person { constructor(name){ this.name = name; } greetAll(peopleArray) { peopleArray.forEach((person) => { //arrow function (subtle difference) console.log(\"Hi\"+person.name+\", I'm \"+this.name); //works correctly! }); } } This property makes arrow functions invaluable when specifying callback functions, particularly once classes and objects are involved. Always use arrow functions for anonymous callbacks! Alternatively, it is possible to “permanently” associate a particular this value with a function, no matter what object that function is called on. This is called binding the this, and is done by calling the .bind() method on the function and passing in the value you want to be assigned to this. The .bind() method will return a new function that has the value bound to it; often you will then take this new function and “re-assign” it to the old function variable: //re-assign function myFunction = myFunction.bind(thisValue); This is a common pattern in React (and has some minuscule performance benefits), but for this class you should stick with arrow functions for cleanliness and readability. Arrow functions are not optional. Always use arrow functions for anonymous callbacks! 14.3 Destructuring and Spreading ES6 also introduced destructing assignments, which allow you to assign each element of an array (or each property of an object) into separate variables all in a single operation. This is called “destructuring” because you are “unpacking” the values of an array into a bunch of different variables. To destructure an array in JavaScript, you write the variables you wish to assign values to inside of square brackets [] on the left-hand side of the assignment—almost like you are assigning to an array! let myArray = [1, 2, 3]; let [x, y, z] = myArray; //assign myArray elements to `x`, `y`, `z` respectively console.log(x); //=> 1; console.log(y); //=> 2; console.log(z); //=> 3; It is also possible to destructure objects using a similar syntax: let myObject = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}; let {a, b, c} = myObject; console.log(a); //=> 1 console.log(b); //=> 2; console.log(c); //=> 3; Note that when destructuring an object, the variables specified on the left side of the assignment are assigned the value from the matching property in the object. Thus in let {a, b, c} = myObject, the a is assigned myObject.a, the b is assigned myObject.b, etc. The order of the elements on eitehr side of the equation doesn’t matter. Any values on the left-hand side that don’t have a corresponding property in the object being destructured will not be assigned a value (will remain undefined). There is syntax to assign values to different variable names as well, see the documentation for details. When destructuring, if the array or object contains more than the target number of elements, the extra elements will be ignored. However, you can capture them by using the spread operator (...), which is used to either gather or spread a sequence of values (e.g., a list of parameters) into or across an array: let dimensions = [10, 20, 30, 40]; let [width, height, ...rest] = dimensions console.log(width); //=> 10 console.log(height); //=> 20 console.log(rest); //=> [30, 40]; the rest of the values! The spread operator is also commonly used to specify that a function can take an undefined number of arguments, and to gather all of these values into a single array: //a function that logs out all of the parameters function printArgs(...args){ //all the parameters will be grouped into a single array `args` args.forEach((arg) => { console.log(arg) //can log out all of them, no matter how many! }); } printArgs('a', 'b', 'c'); //=> \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" printArgs(1,2,3,4,5,6); //=> \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"6\" //a function that adds up all the arguments (no matter how many!) function sum(...numbers) { //numbers is an array, so we can `reduce()` it! let total = numbers.reduce((runningTotal, num) => { return runningTotal + num; //new total }, 0); //start at 0 return total; //or as one line with a concise arrow function: return numbers.reduce((total, n) => total+n); } sum(3 ,4, 3); // => 10 sum(10, 20, 30, 40); // => 100 14.4 Modules So far, you’ve mostly be writing all of your JavaScript code in a single script (e.g., index.js), even if you’d included some other libraries via additional &lt;script&gt; tags. But as applications get larger and more complex, this single script file can quickly become unwieldy with hundreds or thousands of lines of code implementing dozens of features. Such large files become difficult to read and debug (“where was that function defied?”), can introduce problems with the shared global namespace (“did I already declare a user variable?”), and overall mixes code in a way that violates the Separation of Concerns principle. The solution to this problem is to split up your application’s code into separate modules (scripts), each of which is responsible for a separate piece of functionality. And rather than loading each module through a separate &lt;script&gt; tag (potentially leading to ordering and dependency issues while continuing to pollute the global namespace), you can define each module as a self-contained script that explicitly “imports” (loads) the functions and variables it needs from other modules. This allows you to better organize your program as it gets large. While separating code into modules is a common in the Node.js environment, ES6 adds syntax that allows you to treat individual .js files as modules that can communicate with one another. These are known as ES6 Modules. In order to use modules inside of the browser, you’ll need to specify the type=\"module\" attribute for your &lt;script&gt; tag (and loading the page via a web server): &lt;!-- load a script that can include other modules --> &lt;script type=\"module\" src=\"path/to/script.js\">&lt;/script> However, most commonly you will not use modules directly inside of the browser. Instead you will load them through an external build tool like webpack. In these situations, you’ll be using the module loader provided by the Node JavaScript runtime. This loader does introduce some quirks in syntax, which are noted in the syntax explanation. Module Syntax As in Java, ES6 Modules are able to “load” external modules or libraries by using the import keyword: //Java example: import `Random` variable from `java.util` to use globally import java.util.Random //JavaScript: import the `Random` variable from a `util.js` module import { Random } from './util'; This is most common version of the ES6 import syntax: you write the keyword import, following by a set of braces { } containing a comma-separated sequence of variables you wish to “import” from a particular module. This is followed by the from keyword, followed by a string containing the relative path to the module script to import. Note that in Node-based systems (such as the React build environment) including the extension of the module script is optional (by default, the module loader will look for files ending in .js). Be sure to include the ./ to indicate that you’re loading a file from a particular directory. If you leave that off, the Node module loader will look for a module installed on the load path (e.g., in node_modules/). That is how you load external files such as jQuery though: //with jquery installed in `node_modules/` //import the `$` and `jQuery` variables import {$, jQuery} from 'jquery'; If you want to make a variable available from one module to use in another, you will need to export it (so that it can be “imported” elsewhere). You do this by using the export keyword, placed in front of the variable declaration: /*** my-module.js ***/ export let question = \"Why'd the chicken cross the road?\"; export let answer = \"To get to the other side\"; export function laugh() { console.log(\"hahaha\"); } This is called a named export (in contrast to a default export described below). /*** index.js ***/ import { question, answer, laugh } from './my-module'; console.log(question); //=> \"Why'd the chicken cross the road?\" console.log(answer); //=> \"To get to the other side\" laugh(); //\"hahaha\" Note that you can export functions as well as variables, since functions are values! Once a value has been imported, it is available globally (just as if it were defined in a previous &lt;script&gt; tag) There are a number of ways to export and import variables, giving you significant customization on which values you wish to share and load: /*** my-module.js ***/ export function foo() { return 'foo'; } //make available (as above) function bar() { return 'bar'; } export bar; //export previously defined variable export { bar as barFunction }; //provide an \"alias\" (consumer name) for value //will not be available (a \"private\" function) function baz() { return 'baz'; } /*** index.js ***/ import {foo, barFunction} from './my-module'; //import multiple values foo() //=> 'foo' barFunction() //=> 'bar' import {foo as myFoo} from './my-module'; //provide an \"alias\" for value myFoo(); //=> 'foo' import * as theModule from './my-module'; //import everything that was exported //loads as a single object with values //as properties theModule.foo(); //=> 'foo' theModule.barFunction(); //=> 'bar' theModule.baz(); //Error [private function] Note the additional syntax options in this example: You can use the as keyword to “alias” a variable either when it is exported (so it is shared with a different name) or when it is imported (so it is loaded and assigned a different name). This is particularly useful when trying to produce a clean API for a module (so you export values with consistent names, even if you don’t use those internally), or when you want to import a variable with a very long name. It is possible to just import everything that was exported by a module using the import * as syntax. You specify an object name that will represent the values exported module (e.g., theModule in the example), and each exported variable will be a property of that object. This is particularly useful when you may be adding extra exports to a module during development, but don’t want to keep adjusting the import statement. Note also that only the variables you export are made available to other modules! This allows you to make variables and functions that are “private” to a module! Finally, each module can also export a single (just one!) default variable, which provides a slight shortcut when importing the variable from that module. You specify the default export by including the default keyword immediately after export: /*** my-module.js ***/ //this function is the \"default\" export export default function sayHello() { return 'Hello world!'; } /*** index.js ***/ import greet from './my-module'; //import the default value greet(); //=> \"Hello world!\" When importing a default export, you just provide the variable name (“alias”) you wish to refer to that exported value by. Note that it is also possible to make anonymous values into default exports: /*** animals.js ***/ export default ['lion', 'tiger', 'bear']; //export anonymous array The default export technique is particularly common in object-oriented frameworks like React, where you can make each JavaScript module contain the code for a single function or class. That single class can be made the default export, allowing other modules to import it quickly and easily as import MyComponent from './MyComponent.js'. This section describes ES6 modules, which are used with web applications (being part of the ECMAScript specification). However, Node.js by default uses an alternate module loading system called CommonJS. This uses the built-in method require() to load a module (which returns a single “exported” variable as a result). Values are exported from a module by assigning them to the module.exports global. This course will exclusively utilize ES6 Modules, but it’s good to be aware of the alternate CommonJS approach when searching for help. 14.5 Other Features Syntactic Sugar causes cancer of the semicolon - Alan Perlis There are a few other notable syntax options provided by ES6 that you will likely come across. Template Strings In ES6, you can declare Strings that contain embedded expressions, allowing you to “inject” an expression directly into a string (rather than needing to concatenate the String with that expression). These are known as template strings (or template literals). Template strings are written in back ticks (``) rather than quotes, with the injected expressions written inside of a ${} token: let name = 'world'; let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; //template string console.log(greeting); //=> \"Hello, world!\" Template strings can also include line breaks, allowing you to make multi-line strings! Note that you can put any expression inside the ${} token; however, it’s best practice to keep the expression as simple as possible (such as by using a local variable) to support readability: let name = 'world'; //greeting with capitalization. Don't do this! let greeting = `Hello, ${name.substr(0,1).toUpperCase() + name.substr(1)}!` console.log(greeting); //=> \"Hello, world!\"; //do this instead! let capitalizedName = name.substr(0,1).toUpperCase() + name.substr(1); let greeting = `Hello, ${capitalizedName}` console.log(greeting); //=> \"Hello, world!\"; These are a few of the more common and potentially useful ES6 features. However, remember that most of these are just “syntactic shortcuts” for behaviors and functionality you can already achieve using ES5-style JavaScript. Thus you don’t need to utilize these features in your code (though they can be helpful), and they will often show up in how we utilize libraries such as React.

React is “a JavaScript library for building user interfaces” developed by Facebook (though it is released as open-source software). At its core, React allows you to dynamically generate and interact with the DOM, similar to what you might do with jQuery. However, React was created to make it much easier to define and manipulate lots of different parts of the DOM, and to do so quickly (in terms of computer speed). It does this by enabling you to declare a web app in terms of different components (think: “things” on a web page) that can be independently managed—this lets you design and implement web apps at a higher level of abstraction. Moreover, components are usually associated with some set of data, and React will automatically “re-render” (show) the updated component when the data changes—and to do so in a computationally efficient manner. React is currently the most popular “framework” for building large-scale web applications (its chief competitors being Angular and Vue.js, though there are scores of similar frameworks that are also used. Check out TodoMVC for an example of the same application in each!). This means that React is generally very well documented; there are hundreds of tutorials, videos, and examples for building React applications (of which this chapter will be yet another). Some general resources are included at the end of the chapter, but in general we recommend you start with the official documentation, particularly the set of main concepts. Note that this book more or less follows the approach used by Facebooks’s Intro to React Tutorial. React has gone through a couple of different major versions in its short life. Moreover, the “style” in which React is written has also evolved over time as new features are added to both the React library and the JavaScript language. This book introduces and emphasizes an approach that prioritizes clarity of concepts and readability of code, rather than conciseness of syntax or use of advanced options. 15.1 Getting Set Up: Create React App React is a JavaScript library similar to those discussed in previous chapters—you load the library and then can call upon its methods. However, React makes use of a significant amount of advanced and custom JavaScript syntax (described below), including extensive use of ES6 Modules. Thus in practice, using developing React apps requires using a large number of different development tools—just getting setup and started is one of major hurdles in learning React! Luckily, Facebook does provide an amazing application which combines many of these these different development tools together. Create React App (CRA) is a command line application that generates scaffolding (“starter code”) for a React application, as well as provides built-in scripts to run, test, and deploy your code. You can use Create React App to create a new React app by running the program and specifying a name for the folder you want the app to be created inside of. For example, the below command will create a new folder called my-app that contains all of the code and tools necessary to create a React app: # Create a new React app project in a new `my-app` directory # This may take a minute... npx create-react-app my-app --use-npm # Change into new project directory to run further commands cd my-app The npx command is installed alongside npm 5.2.0 and later, and can be used to (temporarily) install and run a global command in a single step. So rather than needing to use npm install -g create-react-app, you can just use npx. If you specify the current directory (.) as the target folder name, Create React App will create a new react app in the current folder! This is useful when you want to create a React app inside an existing cloned GitHub repository. The --use-npm argument is optional, but will make sure that your app uses npm to manage packages and not an alternate manager (like yarn) Running the Development Server After you create a React app, you can use one of CRA’s provides scripts (the start script) to automatically start up a development webserver: # Make sure you are in the project directory cd path/to/project # Run the development server script npm start This will launch the webserver, and open up a new browser window showing the rendered web page! This development webserver will automatically perform the following whenever you change the source code: It will transpile React code into pure JavaScript that can be run in the web browser (see JSX below). It will combine (bundle) all of the different code modules into a single file, and automatically inject that single file into the HTML (adding the &lt;script&gt; tag for you). It will display errors and warnings in your browser window—most errors will show up in the developer console, while fatal errors (e.g., syntax errors that crash the whole app) will be shown as an error web page. Note that the Chrome React Developer Tools will provide further error and debugging options. It will automatically reload the page—whenever you change the source code! All these capabilities are provided by a tool called webpack. Webpack is at its core a module bundler: it takes your complicated source code structure (lots of files) and transforms it into a brand new, “simplified” version (a single file). In the process, can automatically process and change that code—from automatic formatting and styling, to compiling or transpiling from one language to another. Webpack is a fairly complex build tool; however, Create React App provides its own configuration to this program so that you don’t have to do anything with it directly! In order to stop the server, hit ctrl-c on the command line. Important: There is an issue with Create React App on Windows using Git Bash where hitting ctrl-c won’t actually stop the server—if you try to run it again, you’ll get an error about the port still being occupied. Current work-arounds are to use the Task Manager to end the node process, or to instead use the Linux subsystem for Windows. Project Structure A newly created React app will contain a number of different files, including the following: The public/index.html file is the home page for your application when webpack builds the app. If you look at this file, you’ll notice that it doesn’t include any CSS &lt;link&gt; or JavaScript &lt;script&gt; elements—the CSS and JavaScript for your React app will be automatically injected into the HTML file when the app is built and run through the development server. The CSS and JavaScript files will be found in the src/ folder. Similarly, all of the content of the page will be defined as JavaScript components—you’ll be creating the entire page in JavaScript files. Thus in practice, you rarely modify the index.html file (beyond changing the &lt;title&gt; and favicon and such). Overall the public/ folder is where you put assets that you want to be available to your page but aren’t loaded and compiled through the JavaScript (i.e., they’re not “source code”). For example, this is where you would put an img/ folder to hold pictures to show. The public/ folder will be the “root” of the webpage; a file found at public/img/picture.jpg would be referenced in your DOM as img/picture.jpg—using a path relative to the public/ folder. The src/ folder contains the source code for your React app. The app is started by the index.js script, but this script imports and uses other JavaScript modules (such as the provided App.js script, which defines the “App” module). In general, you’ll code React apps by implementing components in one or more modules (e.g., App.js, AboutPage.js), which will then be imported and used by the index.js file. See the Components section below for details. The reportWebVitals.js and setupTests.js are provided by default to better support testing and performance measurements. This text doesn’t cover these features; you can ignore or delete them for now. The src/index.css and src/App.css are both CSS files used to style the entire page and the individual “App” component respectively. Notice that the CSS files are imported from inside the JavaScript files (with e.g., import './index.css'). This is because the webpack build system that Create React App uses to run apps knows how to load CSS files, so you can “include” them through the JavaScript rather than needing to link them in the HTML. If you want to load an external stylesheet, such as Bootstrap or Font-Awesome, you can still do that by modifying the public/index.html file—but it’s better to install them as modules and import them through the JavaScript. See the documentation for Adding Bootstrap for an example. Remember that all CSS is global—rules specified in any .css file will apply to the entire app (i.e., the App.css rules will apply to components other than those in App.js). The CSS is broken into multiple files to try and keep rules organized. You can instead put all your CSS rules into a single file, using naming schema or other techniques to keep them organized. If you are interested in ways to keep the CSS from being applied globally, look into using CSS in JS. The README.md contains a copy of the User Guide (which can also be found online), focused on “how to perform common tasks”. the user guide is very thorough—if you want to do something within the CRA framework, try searching this first, as there is probably a guide and example code for you to use! Overall, you’ll primarily be working with the .js and .css files found in the src/ folder as you develop a React app. Alternatives to Create React App While Create React App is the easiest and recommended way to get started with a React application, it’s also possible to try out React just by including external JavaScript libraries in the same way you would do with jQuery. Note that this approach is not recommended, especially for production systems—it will run much slower, and be harder to develop (you don’t get the useful debugging features of Create React App’s development server). &lt;!-- Load the React library scripts (there are two) --> &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;!-- Load the Babel script --> &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.26.0/babel.min.js\">&lt;/script> The React library actually consists of two libraries that are loaded in the previous code snippet. The react.development.js script is the library used to create React components, while the react-dom.development.js script is the library that handles DOM manipulation. The third script that you loaded (babel) is used to transpile from a React specific code syntax called JSX (described below). This transpiling is the “slow” part; it’s better to do it once at “build time” (through webpage via Create React App) than to do it each time the page is loaded and run. 15.2 JSX At its core, React is simply a DOM creation and rendering library—it allows you to declare new DOM elements (e.g., make a new &lt;h1&gt;) and then add that element to the webpage. This is similar to the process you might do with the DOM or the jQuery library: //Create and render a new `&lt;h1>` element using DOM methods const element = document.createElement('hi'); //create element element.id = 'hello'; //specify attributes element.classList.add('my-class'); element.textContent = 'Hello World!'; //specify content document.getElementById('root').appendChild(element); The React library provides a set of functions that do similar work: //Import required functions from the React libraries import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; //Create a new `&lt;h1>` element using React methods. This function takes //arguments indicating what the element should be const element = React.createElement( 'h1', //html tag { //object of attributes id: 'hello', className: 'my-class' } 'Hello World!' //content ); //Create a \"React root\" out of the `#root` elemment const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); //render the React element at that root root.render(element) React’s React.createElement() lets you create an element (a “React element”, not a pure DOM element—they are different!) by specifying the element type/tag, the content, and an object that maps from attribute names to values—all as a single statement. The ReactDOM.createRoot() function creates a context in which React element can then be rendered (shown on the screen)—usually a div#root on the page. The root’s render() method will then take a particular React element and insert it as the child content of the React root element . Note that root.render() function replaces the content of the root DOM element—it’s a “replace” not an “append” operation. Notice that the class attribute is specified with the className property. This is because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript (it declares a class). The createRoot() function was introduced with React v18 (March 2022). Previous versions of React used the ReactDOM.render() function directly instead of explicitly creating a root context. Using ReactDOM.render() will cause your app to function as if using React v17, preventing some advanced features from working. The React.createElement() function is wordy and awkward to type, particularly if you’ll be defining a lot of DOM elements (and in React, you define the entire application in JavaScript!). Thus React lets you create and define elements using JSX. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript: it provide a new way of writing the language—in particular, the ability to write bare HTML tags (finally!): //Create a new `&lt;h1>` element using JSX syntax const element = &lt;h1 id=\"hello\" className=\"myclass\">Hello World&lt;/h1>; //Show the element in the web page (inside #root) const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(element) The value assigned to the element variable is not a String (it has no quotes around it). Instead it is a syntactical shortcut for calling the React.createElement() function—the HTML-like syntax can be automatically translated into the actual JavaScrip for the method call, allowing you to write the simpler version. Notice that there is still a semicolon (;) at the end of the first line; you’re not actually writing HTML, but defining a JavaScript value using syntax that mostly looks like HTML! JSX can be used to define nested elements; you are not limited to a single element: //JSX can define nested elements const header = ( &lt;header className=\"well\"> &lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1> &lt;/header> ); It’s very common to put elements on their own lines, intended as if you were writing HTML directly. If you do so, you’ll need to surround the entire JSX expression in parentheses () to tell the interpreter that the line break shouldn’t be read as implying a semicolon! Note that similar to XML, JSX syntax requires that all elements be closed; thus you need to use a closing slash at the end of empty elements: //JSX elements must be closed const picture = &lt;img src=\"my_picture.png\" alt=\"A picture\" /> Since JSX is not actually valid JavaScript (you can’t normally include bare HTML), you need to “translate” it into real JavaScript so that the browser can understand and execute it. This process is called transpiling, and is usually performed using a compiler program called Babel. Babel is yet another piece of the toolchain used to create React applications; however, all the details about transpiling with Babel are automatically handled by the Create React App scaffolding. “Transpile with Babel” is one of the steps performed by webpack, which is included and run from the scripts provided by Create React App (whew!). Yes, chaining tools together like this is how modern web development works. In short: you write JSX code, and when you run your app with Create React App it will be turned into regular old JavaScript code that your browser can actually understand. Inline Expressions JSX allows you to include JavaScript expressions (such as variables you want to reference) directly inside of the HTML-like syntax. You do this by putting the expression inside of curly braces ({}): const message = \"Hello world!\"; const element = &lt;h1>{message}&lt;/h1>; When the element is rendered, the expression and the surrounding braces will be replaced by the value of the expression. So the above JSX would be rendered as the HTML: &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;. You can put any arbitrary expression inside of the {}—that is, any JavaScript code that resolves to a single value. This can include math operations, function calls, ternary expressions, or even an anonymous function values (see the next chapter for examples): //Including an inline expression in JSX. The expressions can be mixed directly //into the HTML const element = &lt;p>A leap year has {(365 + 1) * 24 * 60} minutes!&lt;/p>; You can use inline expressions most anywhere in JSX, including as the value of an attribute. You can even declare element attributes as an object and then use the spread operator (...) to specify them as an inline expression. //Define a JavaScript variable const imgUrl = 'path/to/my_picture.png'; //Assign that variable to an element attribute const pic = &lt;img src={imgUrl} alt=\"A picture\" />; //Define an object of element attributes const attributes = { src: 'path/to/other_picture.png', alt: 'Another picture' }; //A DOM element that includes those attributes, among others. //The spread operator applies the property names as attributes of the element. const otherPic = &lt;img {...attributes} className=\"my-class\" />; Notice that when specifying a JavaScript expression as the value of an attribute (as with the src attribute of an &lt;img&gt;), you do not include quotes around the {}. The value of the inline expression is already a string, and it’s that string that you’re assigning to the attribute. Inline expressions aren’t “copy-pasted” into the HTML-style of JSX; rather the values of those expressions are assigned to the object properties represented by the HTML-style attributes. Importantly, the elements defined with JSX are also valid JavaScript expressions! Thus you can use inline expressions to include one element inside of another. //Define variable content to display. One is a string, one is a React element. const greetingString = \"Good morning!\"; const iconElem = &lt;img src=\"sun.png\" alt=\"A wide awake sun\" />; //Conditionally change values based on an `isEvening` value (defined elsewhere) if(isEvening) { greetingString = \"Good evening!\"; iconElem = &lt;img src=\"moon.png\" alt=\"A dozing moon\" />; } //Include the variables inline in another React element //Notice how the `icon` element is included as a child of the `&lt;header>` const header = ( &lt;header> &lt;h1>{greetingString}&lt;/h1> {iconElem} &lt;/header> ); If you include an array of React elements in an inline expression, those those elements will be interpreted as all being children of the parent element (siblings of each other): //An array of React elements. Could also produce via a loop or function const listItems = [&lt;li>lions&lt;/li>, &lt;li>tigers&lt;/li>, &lt;li>bears&lt;/li>]; //Include the array as an inline expression; each `&lt;li>` element will be //included as a child of the `&lt;ul>` const list = &lt;ul>{listItems}&lt;/ul>; The above sample would produce the HTML (formatted for readability): &lt;ul> &lt;li>lions&lt;/li> &lt;li>tigers&lt;/li> &lt;li>bears&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> This is particularly useful when using a variable number of elements, or generating elements directly from data (see the Props and Composition section below). As a final note: you cannot include HTML comments (&lt;!-- --&gt;) inside of JSX, as this isn’t actually an element type. You also can’t use inline JavaScript comments (//), because even multi-line JSX is still a single expression (that’s why the &lt;header&gt; example above is written in parentheses). Thus in order to include a comment in JSX, you can use a JavaScript block comment (/* */) inside of an inline expression: const main = ( &lt;main> { /* A comment: the main part of the page goes here... */ } &lt;/main> ) (This is complex enough that inlining comments in JSX isn’t very common. It’s better to instead structure your code so that your JSX expressions are short and self-explanatory—such as by organizing your content into Components). 15.3 React Components When creating React applications, you use JSX to define the HTML content of your webpage directly in the JavaScript. However, writing all of the HTML out as one giant JSX expression doesn’t provide much advantage over just putting that content in .html files in the first place. Instead, the React library encourages and enables you to describe your web page in terms of components, instead of just HTML elements. In this context, a component is a “piece” of a web page. For example, in a social media application, each “status post” on a timeline might be a different component, the “like” button may be its own component, the “what are you thinking about?” form would be a component, the page navigation would be a component, and so forth. Thus you can almost think of a component as a semantic abstraction of a &lt;div&gt; element—a “chunk” of the page. But like with &lt;div&gt;s, a component can be seen as made of of other components—you might have a “Timeline” component that is made up of many “StatusPost” components, and each StatusPost component may include a “ReactionButton” component. Thinking about a page in terms of components instead of HTML elements can make it much easier to design and reason about your page—you don’t need to worry about the code syntax or the specific element to use, you can just think of your page in terms of its overall layout and content—what needs to be on the page, and how that content is organized—the same way you might mock up a web page in a graphic design program. See the documentation article Thinking in React for an example of how to design a page in terms of components. React enables you to implement your page in terms of explicit components by providing a way for you to define your own XML elements! Thus you can define a &lt;Timeline&gt; element, which has multiple &lt;StatusPost&gt; elements as children. Components will be able to be included directly in your JSX, made up of and mixed in with standard HTML elements. An example page broken up into components. Example from http://coenraets.org/blog/2014/12/sample-mobile-application-with-react-and-cordova/ &lt;App> &lt;HomePage> &lt;Header /> &lt;SearchBar /> &lt;EmployeeList> &lt;EmployeeListItem person=\"James King\" /> &lt;EmployeeListItem person=\"Julie Taylor\" /> &lt;EmployeeListItem person=\"Eugene Lee\" /> &lt;/EmployList> &lt;/HomePage> &lt;EmployeePage> &lt;Header /> ... &lt;/EmployeePage> &lt;/App> React components are most commonly defined using function components: JavaScript functions that return the DOM elements (the JSX) that will be rendered on the screen: //Define a component representing information about a user function UserInfo(props) { //This is an everyday function; you can include any code you want here const name = \"Ethel\"; const descriptor = \"Aardvark\"; //Return a React element (JSX) that is how the component will appear return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>{name}&lt;/h1> &lt;p>Hello, my name is {name} and I am a {descriptor}&lt;/p> &lt;/div> ) } //Create a new value (a React element) //This syntax in effect \"calls\" the function const infoElement = &lt;UserInfo />; //Show the element in the web page (inside #root) const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(infoElement); This function defines a new component (think: a new HTML element!) called UserInfo. Things to note about defining this component: A component function must be named starting with a Capital letter (and usually in CamelCase). This is to distinguish a custom component from a “normal” React element. If you see a function with a Capitalized name, know that it’s actually a defining a Component! It’s also possible for function components to be defined as anonymous arrow functions assigned to const variables: const Example = props => { return &lt;div>...&lt;/div> } This provides some benefits in terms of scoping (because of the arrow function), but otherwise makes components even harder to read—its not as readily obviously that this is a function and a component. You should stick to defining component functions using the function keyword (and not arrow functions) for readability, but be aware of the alternate approach which is used in some libraries and examples. Component functions take in a single argument representing the props (discussed below), which is conventionally named as such. As with all JavaScript functions, if you don’t to use the argument value you can omit giving it a name (e.g., function UserInfo() { ... }). A component function is a regular function like any other that you’ve written. That means that it can and often does do more than just return a single value! You can include additional code statements (variable declarations, if statements, loops, etc) in order to calculate the values you’d like to include in inline expressions in the returned JSX. Style requirement: perform any complex logic—including functional looping such as with map() or filter()—outside of the return statement. Keep the return statement as simple as possible to it remains readable—and more importantly debuggable (so you can use things like console.log statements to check intermediate values before they are returned). NEVER include an inline callback function so that you have a return statement inside of a return statement! A component function can only return a single React element (you can’t return more than one value at a time from a JavaScript function). However, that single React element can have as many children as you wish. It’s very common to “wrap” all of the content you want a component to include in a single &lt;div&gt; to return, as in the above example. Once it’s been defined, a component can then be created in JSX using XML-style syntax, just like any other element (i.e., as &lt;UserInfo /&gt;). In effect, this “calls” the function component in order to create it—you never call the function directly. You can use the created component like any other React element, such as including it as a child of other HTML (e.g., nest it inside of a &lt;div&gt;). A component thus encapsulates a chunk of HTML, and you can almost think of it as a “shortcut” for including that HTML. Because components are instantiated as React elements, that means that you can use them anywhere you would use a normal HTML element—including in the returned value of another component! This is called composing components—you are specifying that one component is “composed” (made up of) others: //A component representing a message function HelloMessage() { return &lt;p>Hello World!&lt;/p>; } //A component representing another message function GoodbyeMessage() { return &lt;h1>See ya later!&lt;/h1>; } //A component that is composed of (renders) other components! function MessageList() { return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>Messages for you&lt;/h1> &lt;HelloMessage /> {/* include a HelloMessage component */} &lt;GoodbyeMessage /> {/* include a GoodbyeMessage component */} &lt;/div> ); } //Render an instance of the \"top-level\" (\"outer\") component const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(&lt;MessageList />); In the above example, the MessageList component is composed of (renders) instances of the HelloMessage and GoodbyeMessage components; when the MessageList is displayed, the interpreter will create the two other components, rendering each in turn. In the end, all of the content displays will be standard HTML elements—they’ve just been organized into components. Components are usually instantiated as empty elements, though it is possible to have them include child elements. Notice that you can and do mix standard HTML elements and components together; components are just providing a useful abstraction for organizing content, logic, and data! In practice, React applications are made up of many different components—dozens or even hundreds depending on the size of the app! The “top-most” component is commonly called App (since it represents the whole “app”), with the App’s returned value instantiating further components, each of which represents a different part of the page. For example, a common pattern is to “wrap” a rendered &lt;App&gt; component in a &lt;React.StrictMode&gt; component: import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render( &lt;React.StrictMode> &lt;App /> &lt;/React.StrictMode> ); The StrictMode component is provided by React (it’s a property of the React object imported in the first line of the above example). Like the use strict declaration for JavaScript, this component enables a number of additional error checking that React can perform. While most of the issues it identifies are due to using out-of-date practices so you may not see any of its warnings, but it’s still a good idea to include it when developing! See Props and Composition below for more even examples of common ways that React components are composed. Alternative: Class Components It is alternatively possible to define components as classes (using ES6 Class syntax) that acts as a template or blueprint for that content. In particular, you define a class that inherits from the React.Component class—this inheritance means that the class you define IS A React Component! //Define a class component representing information about a user class UserInfo extends React.Component { //Components MUST override the `render()` function, which must return a //DOM element render() { //This is an everyday function; you can include any code you want here const name = \"Ethel\"; const descriptor = \"Aardvark\"; //Return a React element (JSX) that is how the component will appear return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>{name}&lt;/h1> &lt;p>Hello, my name is {name} and I am a {descriptor}&lt;/p> &lt;/div> ) } } //instantiate the class as a new value (a React element) const infoElement = &lt;UserInfo />; //Show the element in the web page (inside #root) const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(infoElement); This “class component” example is identical to the previous function component example—it takes the “body” of the function component and moves that into a (required) render() method. Note that the React.Component class is often imported as a named import, so that you can refer to it directly: import {Component} from 'react'; class MyComponent extends Component { render() { //... } } In general function components are sufficient for defining most React components; you only need to use classes when you want to specify and use any additional methods (and there are ways to do that when using function components as well). See React Class Components for more details about working with class components (particularly for handling their state). Additionally, older versions of React included a function React.createClass() that took in an object whose properties were functions that would act as class methods (see here for details). Although this function has been removed, it’s worth being aware of in case you come across older examples of React code that you need to interpret or adapt. Component Organization React applications will often have dozen of components, quickly growing more complex than the basic starting examples in the previous section. If you tried to define all of these components in a single index.js file, your code would quickly become unmanageable. Thus individual components are usually defined inside of separate modules (files), and then imported by the modules that need them—other components or the root index.js file. Recall that in order to make a variable or function (e.g., a Component) available to other modules, you will need to export that component from its own module, and then import that value elsewhere: /* in Messages.js file */ //Export the defined components (as named exports) export function HelloMessage() { /* ... */ } export function GoodByeMessage() { /* ... */ } /* in App.js file */ //Import components needed from other modules import { HelloMessage, GoodbyeMessage } from `./Messages.js`; //named imports! //Can also export as a _default_ export; common if the file has only one component export default function App() { return ( &lt;div> {/* Use the imported components */} &lt;HelloMessage /> &lt;GoodbyeMessage /> &lt;/div> ) } /* in index.js file */ //Import components needed from other modules import App from `./App.js`; //default import! //Render the imported component const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(&lt;App />); This structure allows you to have each component (or set of related components) in a different file, helping to organize your code. Notice that this “export-import” structure implies a one-directional hierarchy: the Message components don’t know about the App component that will render them (they are self-contained). You should not have two files that import from each other! The index.js file will usually just import a single component; that file stays very short and sweet. Put all of your component definitions in other files. It is common to use the file system to further organize your component modules, such as grouping them into different folders, as in the below example: src/ |-- components/ |-- App.js |-- navigation/ |-- NavBar.js |-- utils/ |-- Alerts.js |-- Buttons.js index.js Note that a module such as Alerts.js might define a number of different “Alert” components to use; these could be imported into the NavBar.js or App.js modules as needed. The App.js component would be imported by the index.js file, which would contain the call to root.render(). Note that it is not necessary to put each different component in a separate module; think about what kind of file organize will make it easy to find your code and help others to understand how your app is structured! 15.4 Properties (props) One of the main goals of using a library such as React is to support data-driven views—that is, the content that is rendered on the page can be based on some underlying data, providing a visual representation of that data. And if that underlying data changes, React can automatically and efficiently “re-render” the view, making the page dynamic. You can specify the underlying data that a React component will be representing by specifying properties (usually just called props) for that component. Props are the “input parameters” to a component—they are the details you pass to it so that it knows what and how to render its content. You pass a prop to a component when you instantiate it by specifying them as XML attributes (using name=value syntax)—the props are the “attributes” of the component! //Passing a prop called `message` with value \"Hello property\" const messageA = &lt;MessageItem message=\"Hello property!\" />; //Passing a prop using an inline expression const secret = \"Shave and a haircut\"; const messageB = &lt;MessageItem message={secret} />; //A component can accept multiple props //This component takes in a `userName` prop as well as a `descriptor` prop const userInfo = &lt;UserInfo userName=\"Ethel\" descriptor=\"Aardvark\" />; Prop names must be valid JavaScript identifiers, and so should be written in camelCase (like variable names). Components are usually defined so that they expect a certain set of props—similar to how a function is defined to expect a certain set of arguments. It is possible to pass “extra” props to the Component (by specifying additional XML attributes), but if the component doesn’t expect those props it won’t do anything with them. Similarly, failing to pass an expected prop will likely result in errors—just like if you didn’t pass a function an expected argument! For function components, the props are received as a single argument to the function (usually called props). This argument is a regular JavaScript object whose keys are the props’ “names”: //Define a component representing information about a user function UserInfo(props) { //access the individual props from inside the argument object const userName = props.userName; const descriptor = props.descriptor; //can use props for logic or processing const userNameUpper = props.userName.toUpperCase(); return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>{userNameUpper}&lt;/h1> &lt;p>Hello, my name is {name} and I am a {descriptor}&lt;/p> &lt;/div> ) } const userInfo = &lt;UserInfo userName=\"Ethel\" descriptor=\"Aardvark\" />; Again, all props are stored in the argument object—you have to access them through that value. To avoid having to type props.___ all the time, it’s common to use object destructuring to assign all of the props to variables in a single line: function UserInfo(props) { //assign the prop object properties to variables const {userName, descriptor} = props; return &lt;h1>{userName}&lt;/h1>; } It’s also possible to specify the object destructuring in the argument declaration! //The props object passed in will be destructured into two argument variables function UserInfo({userName, descriptor}) { return &lt;h1>{userName}&lt;/h1>; } This can help make it clear in the source code what props a component expects, though can make the code somewhat more difficult to parse (since there are so many parentheses and curly braces). However, to keep the idea of the props clear, all examples in this book will use a single, non-destructured props object. Importantly, props can be any kind of value! This includes basic types such as Numbers or Strings, data structures such as Arrays or Objects, or even functions or other component instances! //Props can be of any data type! //Pass an array as a prop! const array = [1,2,3,4,5]; const suitcase = &lt;Suitcase luggageCombo={array} />; //Pass a function as a prop (like a callback)! function sayHello() { console.log('Hello world!'); } const greeting = &lt;Greeting callback={sayHello} />; //Pass another Component as a prop (not common)! const card = &lt;HolidayCard message=\"Greetings world!\" /> const gift = &lt;Gift toMsg=\"Ethel\", fromMsg={card} /> Indeed, passing callback functions as props to other components is a major step in designing interactive React applications. See the next chapter for more details and examples. Props and Composition Recall that React components are usually composed, with one component’s returned value including instances of other components (as in the MessageList example above). Since props are specified when a component instance is created, this means that a “parent” component will need to specify the props for its children (“passing the props”). Commonly, the props for the child components will be derived from the props of the parent component: //Defines a component representing a message in a list function MessageItem(props) { return &lt;li>{props.message}&lt;/li> } //A component that renders a trio of messages function MessageListTrio(props) { const messages = props.messages; //assign prop to a local variable for convenience return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>Messages for you&lt;/h1> &lt;ul> {/* instantiate child components, passing data from own props */} &lt;MessageItem message={messages[0]} /> &lt;MessageItem message={messages[1]} /> &lt;MessageItem message={messages[2]} /> &lt;/ul> &lt;/div> ); } //Define and pass a prop to the parent comment when rendering it const messagesArray = [\"Hello world\", \"No borders\", \"Go huskies!\"]; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(&lt;MessageListTrio messages={messagesArray}); This creates a one-directional data flow—the data values are passed into the parent, which then passes data down to the children (not vice versa). The component organization in the previous example is particularly common in React. In order to effectively render a list (array) of data, you should define a Component that declares how to render a single element of that list (e.g., MessageItem). This allows you to focus on only a single problem, developing a re-usable solution. Then you define another component that represents how to render a whole list of elements (e.g., MessageList). This component will render a child item component for each element—it just needs to set up the list, without worrying about what each item looks like! The data set can be passed into the parent (List) component as a prop, and each individual element from that data set will be passed into an instance of the child (Item) component. In effect, the List component is tasked with with taking the data set (an array of data values) and producing a set Item components (an array of Components). This kind of transformation is a mapping operation (each data value is mapped to a Component), and so can be done effecttively with the map() method: //Map an array of message strings to an array of components const msgItems = props.messages.map((msgString) => { const component = &lt;MessageItem message={msgString} />; //pass prop down! return component; //add this new component to resulting array }) And because including an array of Components as an inline expression in JSX will render those elements as siblings, it’s easy to render this list from within the parent: function MessageList(props) { const msgItems = props.messages.map((msgString) => { const component = &lt;MessageItem message={msgString} />; //pass prop down! return component; //add this new component to resulting array }) return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>Messages for you&lt;/h1> &lt;ul> {/* render the array of MessageList components */} {msgItems} &lt;/ul> &lt;/div> ); } //Define and pass a prop to the parent comment when rendering it const messagesArray = [\"Hello world\", \"No borders\", \"Go huskies!\"]; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(&lt;MessageList messages={messagesArray}); Note that the above example will issue a warning in the developer console. This is because React requires you to specify an additional prop called key for each element in an array of components. The key should be a unique string for each element in the list, and acts as an identifier for that element (think: what you might give it as an id attribute). React will use the key to keep track of those elements, so if they change over time (i.e., elements are added or removed from the array) React will be able to more efficiently modify the DOM. If unspecified, the key will default to the element’s index in the array, but this is considered unstable (since it will change as items are added or removed). Thus a better approach is to determine a unique value based on the data—which means that data items will need to be uniquely identifiable. The below improved version of the code changes each message from a basic String to an Object that has content and id properties, allowing each data value to be uniquely identified. Note that the MessageItem component need not be changed; it still renders an &lt;li&gt; showing the given message prop! const messageObjArray = [ {content: \"Hello world\", id: 1} {content: \"No borders\", id: 2} {content: \"Go huskies!\", id: 3} ]; function MessageList(props) { const msgItems = props.messages.map((msgObject) => { //return a new MessageItem for each message object //attributes are listed on their own lines for readability return &lt;MessageItem message={msgObject.content} key={msgObject.id.toString()} {/* pass in a key prop! */} />; }) //end of .map() return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>Messages for you&lt;/h1> &lt;ul> {msgItems} &lt;/ul> &lt;/div> ); //end of return } //Define and pass a prop to the parent comment when rendering it const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(&lt;MessageList messages={messageObjArray}); This pattern enables you to effectively define your web page’s content in terms of individual components that can be composed together, allowing you to quickly render large amounts of data (without needing spend a lot of time thinking about loops!). Resources As mentioned above, there are a large number of different resources for learning React. Below are links to key parts of the official documentation. Thinking in React Facebook’s React Tutorial React Documentation JSX Documentation Components and Props React API References Create React App Docs "],["interactive-react.html", "Chapter 16 Interactive React 16.1 Handling Events in React 16.2 State and Hooks 16.3 Specific Interactions Resources", " Chapter 16 Interactive React This chapter discussed how websites built using the React library can be made interactive, with Components that render different content in response to user actions. Specifically, it details how to idiomatically handle events, store dynamic information in a Component’s state using hooks, as well as perform some specific common interactions (such as using forms and downloading data). 16.1 Handling Events in React You can handle user interaction in React in the same way you would using the DOM or jQuery: you register an event listener and specify a callback function to execute when that event occurs. In React, you register event listeners by specifying a React-specific attribute on an element. The attribute is generally named with the word on followed by the name of the event you want to respond to in camelCase format. For example, onClick registers a listener for click events, onMouseOver for mouseover events, and so on. You can see the full list of supported event handling attributes in the documentation for synthetic events. The attribute should be assigned a value that is a reference to a callback function (specified as an inline expression). //A component representing a button that logs a message when clicked function MyButton() { //A function to call when clicked. The name is conventional, but arbitrary. //The callback will be passed the DOM event (just like with DOM callbacks) const handleClick = function(event) { console.log(\"clicky clicky\"); } //make a button with an `onClick` attribute! //this \"registers\" the listener and sets the callback return &lt;button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!&lt;/button>; } This component renders a &lt;button&gt; in the DOM with a registered click event. Clicking on that DOM element will cause the handleClick function to be executed. For readability, the above example specifies the callback function as a separate function (defined inside of the component—so yes, a function created inside of a function)! Note that it is more common to define nested callbacks using arrow functions: const handleClick = (event) => { console.log('clicky clicky'); } You can also specify a callback function inline in the JSX, though this can quickly get messy and hard to read with complex event handling, so is not recommended. function MyButton() { return &lt;button onClick={(evt) => console.log(\"clicky clicky\")}/> } Importantly, you can only register events on React elements (HTML elements like &lt;button&gt;, that are named with lowercase letters), not on Components. If you tried to specify a &lt;MyButton onClick={callback}&gt;, you would be passing a prop that just happened to be called onClick, but otherwise has no special meaning! Although functionally similar, React event handling attributes are NOT the same as HTML event handles—React’s onClick is different from HTML’s onclick. The React attributes are specialized to work within the React event system. In the end, they’re similar to a JSX-based syntactic shortcut for using addEventListener(), so we aren’t actually mixing concerns more! 16.2 State and Hooks The previous section describes how to respond to user-generated events, but in order for the page to be interactive you need to be able to manipulate its rendered content when that event occurs. For example, you could click on a button and show how many times it was pressed, select a table column to sort the data by that feature, or select a component in order to show an entirely different “page” of content (see Chapter 19). To achieve these effects, a component will need to keep track of its state or situation—the number on the counter, how the table is sorted, or which “page” is being shown. In React, a component’s state represents internal, dynamic information about how that Component should be rendered. The state contains data that changes over time (and only such information—if the value won’t change for that instance of a component, it shouldn’t be part of the state!). Moreover, whenever the state is changed, a React component will automatically “rerender”—the component will be “rerun” and the new, updated DOM elements returned will be displayed on the screen (replacing the previously rendered version). In short: changing the state will “refresh” the component! State can be specified for a function component by using a state hook. Hooks are functions provided by React that let you “hook into” the framework’s rendering and displaying processes. The state hook in particular lets you hook into the state of a component, specifying what values should be “tracked” and should cause the component to rerender. Hooks were introduced with React v16.8 (October 2018), and thus are the “new” current way of handling state. For details on older techniques (which require using class components), see State in Class Components. Fun fact: hooks are basically an example of mixins, which are an object-oriented technique for including/injecting data or behavior in a class without needing to inherit that behavior from a parent class. The state hook is a function provided by React called useState(). This function will need to be imported from the React library (note that it is a named export so should be imported as such): //import the state hook function import React, { useState } from 'react'; The useState() function is then called within the component function (usually at the top of the function so that the resulting variables will be available to use): function CountingButton() { //Define a `count` state variable, initially 0 const [count, setCount] = useState(0); //an event handling callback const handleClick = (event) => { setCount(count+1); //update the state to be a new value } return ( { /* a button with the event handler that displays the state variable */} &lt;button onClick={handleClick}>You clicked me {count} times&lt;/button> ); } Calling the useState() function creates a “state variable”—a value that will be tracked and stored between calls to render/rerender the component. You can almost think of a state variable as like an “instance variable” for the function (and indeed, state is stored in object instance variables). The useState() function is passed the initial starting value for the state variable. In above example, the count state variable will be initialized as 0. The useState() function returns an array of two values: the first is the current value of the state (e.g., what it was initialized as), and the second is a function used to modify that particular state variable (a “setter” or mutator). By convention, you use array destructuring to assign these two values to two separate variables in a single operation. Thus the above line calling useState() can be read as a shorthand for: const hookArray = useState(0); //the function returns an array of 2 values const count = hookArray[0]; //assign the 1st elem (a value) to `count` const setCount = hookArray[1]; //assign the 2nd elem (a function) to `setCount` Importantly, there is nothing magical about the names of the variables that the useState() result is assigned to. It could just as well have been written: const [countVariable, functionToUpdateCount] = useState(0) Because the function is a “setter” it’s usually named as such (setVARIABLE), but this is not required. It’s just a function; you can name it whatever you want. Because the current state value is assigned to a regular variable (e.g., count in the above example), you can use it anywhere you would use a variable—such as in an inline expression to display the value. Note that if the value isn’t actually used in the rendered DOM in any way (directly or indirectly), it probably shouldn’t be part of the state! Updating State It’s not possible to change the value of a state variable directly (e.g,. you can’t do count = count +1)—that’s why the variable is declared as const! Instead, you need to use the “set state” function that was created (e.g., setCount() in the above example). This function will take as an argument the new value to assign to the state variable (overwriting the previous value). When the set state function is called, not only will it change the value of the state variable, but it will also “rerender” the component—it will cause the component function to be called again, returning a new set of DOM elements to be shown on the screen. These DOM elements will replace the previously rendered version of the component; React merges these changes into the page’s DOM in a highly efficiency manner, changing only the elements that have actually updated—this is what makes React so effective for large scale systems. This is one of the trickier parts to remember in React: when you call a set state function, it will cause your component function to “re-run”—which means that any logic will execute for a second time (though now the “current” value of the state variable will be updated, rather than the initial value passed into useState). Never call a set state function directly from inside of your component function; only in callbacks (such as for event handling). Calling setCount() directly would cause an infinite recursive loop. Component functions must remain “pure” with no side effects. Moreover, set state functions are asynchronous. Calling the function only sends a “request” to update the state; it doesn’t happen immediately. This is because React will “batch” multiple requests to update the state of components (and so to rerender them) together—that way if your app needs to make lots of small changes at the same time, React only needs to regenerate the DOM once, providing a significant performance boost. //An Component with a callback that doesn't handle asynchronous state changes function CounterWithError(props) { const [count, setCount] = useState(3) //initial value of 3 const handleClick = (event) => { setCount(4); //change `count` to 4 console.log(count); //will output \"3\"; state has not changed yet! } } In this example, because setCount() is asynchronous, you can’t immediately access the updated state variable after calling the function. You instead need to wait for the component to “rerender”—when the component’s DOM is regenerated, it will use the updated value. If you want to see that value, log it out right before you return the DOM (not inside of the click event handler). It is possible to have multiple state variables, each declared with a different all to useState(): //Example from React documentation function ExampleWithManyStates() { //Declare multiple state variables! const [age, setAge] = useState(42); const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana'); const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]); } While it’s possible for a single state variable to contain complex values (objects and arrays, as in the todos variable above), it’s often cleaner to use multiple different state variables—that way React needs to change as little data as possible when you wish to update a variable. Importantly, you need to pass a new value into the set state function in order for it to actually update the state and rerender the component. Just changing a value inside of an existing object won’t work: function TodoListWithError() { //a state value that is an array of objects const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]); const handleClick = (event) => { todos[0].text = \"Fix bugs\"; //modify the object but don't make a new one setTodos(todos) //This won't work! } } In the above example, changing a property of the todos array-of-objects doesn’t actually change the value. This when you call setTodos(todos), React thinks that nothing has updated (it doesn’t do a deep inspection of the object) so doesn’t update anything. Instead, you’ll need to create a new copy of the array or object, and then pass that new value into the set state function: function TodoList() { //a state value that is an array of objects const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]); const handleClick = (event) => { //create a copy of the array using the `map()` function const todosCopy = todos.map((todoObject, index) => { if(index == 0) { //transform objects if needed todoObject.text = \"Fix bugs\" } return todoObject; //return object to go into new array }) setTodos(todosCopy) //This works! } } This is because React wants to encourage data to remain immutable (you don’t change it, you just make a altered copy) and for functions to avoid side effects (where they change something outside of themselves) in order to help maintain consistency of your data. The .map() function is usually the easiest way to copy an array, though other techniques exist as well. If you wish to copy an object, you can do this easily using the spread operator to create a new object using the properties of the first: //an original object const original = {a: 1, b: 2}; //Create a copy, taking the property of `original` and assigning them into //a fresh object const copy = { ...original } //using the spread operator console.log(copy) //{a: 1, b: 2} console.log(copy == original) //false, different objects (The Object.assign() function) is also used to do a similar operation, but the spread operator is easier to read) State vs. Props Importantly, a Component’s state is different from its props. Although state and props make look similar, they have very different roles. Many developers get the two confused—to the point that React has an FAQ entry about the difference! The key difference between props and state is: props are for information that doesn’t change from the Component’s perspective, including “initial” data. state is for information that will change, usually due to user interaction. Props are the “inputs” into a component, the values that someone else tells the Component it should. That is why the are passed in as arguments! Props are immutable—from the component’s perspective; they cannot be changed once set (though a parent could create a different version of the component with different props). State is “internal” to the Component, and is (only) for values that change over time. If the value doesn’t change over the life of the Component (e.g., in response to a user event), it shouldn’t be part of the state! To quote from the documentation: State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. For example, a SortableTable component might be used to render a list of data. But as the data in the list would come from elsewhere (e.g., the overall App) and wouldn’t be changed by the table, it would be passed in as a prop. However, the order in which that data is displayed might change—thus you could save an orderBy value in the state, and then use that to organize what elements are returned by the component function. The data itself doesn’t change, but how it is rendered does! It is possible to use the props to initialize a state variable (since props are the “initial values” for the Component), though the props would not be changed later: //A component representing a count function Counter(props) { const [count, setCount] = useState(props.startAt) } let counter = &lt;Counter startAt={5} /> In this case the state variable keeps track of the count, though the prop specifies an initial number. The count variable will change in the future, but the props.startAt value will not. It’s important that you only use state to track values that will change over the life of the Component. If you’re not sure if a value should be part of the state, consider the following: Is the value passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state. Does the value remain unchanged over time? If so, it definitely isn’t state. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state. The last of these rules is important. In general, you should keep the state as minimal as possible—meaning you want to have as little data as possible in the state. This is to help avoid duplicating information (which can get out of sync), as well as to speed up how React will “re-render” Components when the state changes. One of the most difficult parts of architecting a React application is figuring out what information should be stored in the props or state (and in which components). We suggest you practice using simple examples, and think carefully about it as you build more robust applications. Lifting Up State In React, a component state is purely internal to that component—neither the component’s parent element nor its children have access to (or are even aware of) that state. State represents only information about that particular component (and that particular instance of the component). Sometimes a child component (i.e., a component instantiated as part of the returned DOM) needs some data that is stored in the state—for example, a BlogPost component might need a data value that is stored in the Blog’s comments state variable. Components can make information available to their children by passing that data to them as a prop: function Blog(props) { const [posts, setPosts] = useState([...]) //initialize the state return ( &lt;div> &lt;h2>Most Recent Post&lt;/h2> {/* pass in values from state as a prop */} &lt;BlogPost postText={posts[0]} /> &lt;/div> ) } In this example, the BlogPost would be passed the individual “post text” data as a normal prop, without being aware that the data was actually stored in the Blog’s state. When that data changes (e.g., when a new post is added), the component function will be called again and the BlogPost component will be re-instantiated with a new value for its prop—again, without any knowledge that there was a change. From the perspective of the BlogPost, there has only ever been a single postText value (the BlogPost with a different text is actually a different BlogPost object!). While passing state data to a child (as a prop) is easy, communicating state data to a parent or sibling is more complicated. For example, you may want to have a SearchForm component that is able to search for data, but want to then have a sibling ResultsList component that is able to display the rendered results: &lt;App> &lt;SearchForm /> {/* has the data */} &lt;ResultsList /> {/* needs the data */} &lt;/App> When confronted with this problem, the best practice in React is to lift the state up to the the closest common ancestor. This means that instead of having the data be stored in the state of one of the children, you instead store the data in the state of the parent. The parent can then pass that information down to the children (as props) for them to use. This way the data always flows “down” the tree. “Lift up” the state to the closest common ancestor to share data between sibling elements But with the state stored in the parent, the children elements (e.g., the SearchForm) may still need a way to interact with that parent and tell it to change its state. To do this, you can have the parent define a function that changes its state, and then pass the child that callback function as a prop. The child will then be able to execute that callback prop, thereby telling the parent to do something (such as update its state!) It’s like the parents write down their instructions, and then hand them to the child to do later! In the following example, the parent component (VotingApp) stores state data about how many times each button has been pressed, passing a callback function (countClick) to its child Components (CandidateButton). The CandidateButton will then execute that callback when it is clicked. Executing this function causes the VotingApp to update its state and re-render the buttons, which show updated text based on the props given to them (namely: who is winning!). function VotingApp(props) { //initialize the state counts, one for each color //using a single state value so that there is only one \"update\" function const [counts, setCounts] = useState({red: 0, blue: 0}) //a function to update the state //expects a \"color\" for which button was clicked const handleCount = function(color) { console.log(color + \" got a vote!\"); const newCounts = { ...counts } //make a duplicate of the object newCounts[color]++; //update the local copy setCounts(newCounts) //update the state with the changed copy } //render based on current state let winner = \"tie\"; if(counts.red > counts.blue) winner = \"red\" else if(counts.blue > counts.red) winner = \"blue\" return ( &lt;div> &lt;p>Current winner is: {winner}&lt;/p> {/* Pass the callback to each button as a prop */} &lt;CandidateButton color=\"red\" winner={winner} callback={handleCount} /> &lt;CandidateButton color=\"blue\" winner={winner} callback={handleCount} /> &lt;/div> ); } function CandidateButton() { const handleClick = () => { //On click, execute the given callback function (passing in own name) props.callback(props.color) } //render based on current props let label = \"I am not winning\"; if(props.winner === props.color) label = \"I am winning!\" return ( &lt;button className={props.color} onClick={handleClick}> {label} &lt;/button> ); } As with many React systems, there are a lot of moving parts that fit together. To understand how this example works, try “tracing” the code that occurs when the CountingApp is first rendered, and then what happens when a button is clicked. Remember that calling setCounts() causes the component to be re-rendered (the function is re-run)! Finally, notice in particular that the CandidateButton class knows nothing about its parent or indeed any information about how it is used (or even if there are other CandidateButton instances). Instead, it simply renders itself based on its props, and executes whatever callback function it was given whenever it is clicked (without carrying about what that function does). Having lots of “simple” components like this is the best way to design React apps. In summary, in order to make an interactive React application, perform the following steps: Start with a “static” (non-interactive) version, with appropriate Components Identify variables that will change so need to be stored in the state Define state variables in the “lowest” common ancestor for Components that need it Pass state information to child Components as props Pass callback functions as props to child Components so they can modify the state. 16.3 Specific Interactions This section provides some details on specific types of interactions commonly used in React apps but require further details and explanation. Working with Forms One of the most common reasons to track state in a React app is when developing forms that the user can fill out to submit information. Forms are a common structure to use when getting user input—whether it’s a “search form” for browsing a data set, or a “login form” for allowing a user access to personalized data. In normal HTML, form elements such as &lt;input&gt; keep track of their own “state”. For example, whatever the user has typed into a text input will be stored in that input’s value property: //Select the &lt;input type=\"text\"> element let textInput = document.querySelector('input[type=\"text\"]'); //Event that occurs whenever the input is changed textInput.addEventListener('change', (event) => { let input = event.target; console.log(input.value); //access that elements \"state\" }); You will often want React to be able to respond to user data entered into a form—either because you want to send an AJAX request based on that data, or because you want to perform form validation and confirm that the user has entered appropriate input (e.g., that the password is at least 6 characters long). But storing the user input in the &lt;input&gt; element’s state can cause problem for React: React components won’t know that they should “rerender” when that changes, and updating a React component might cause the entire DOM tree to re-render (producing a new &lt;input&gt; element with a different value state). Thus the recommended practice for working with forms in React is to use controlled Components. In this case, you define a component that will track the state of what the user has typed into the &lt;input&gt;, and then will render an &lt;input&gt; with an appropriate value property. Rather than letting the &lt;input&gt; control its own state, the React component controls the state and then dictates to the &lt;input&gt; element what value it should be showing. It’s like React is snatching the data from the &lt;input&gt; and then claiming credit for it. function MyInput(props) { const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('')//initialize as empty string //respond to input changes const handleChange = (event) => { //get the value that the &lt;input> now has let newValue = event.target.value //update the state to use that new value, rendering the component setInputValue(newValue); } return ( &lt;div> {/* The input will be rendered with the React-controlled value */} &lt;input type=\"text\" onChange={handleChange} value={inputValue} /> &lt;p>You typed: {inputValue}&lt;/p> &lt;/div> ); } The above is an example of a basic controlled Component. When the user enters a different value into the &lt;input&gt; element, the handleChange() callback is executed. This grabs that updated value and saves it in the component’s inputValue state variable. Updating that state variable also causes the component to re-render, which recreates a brand new version of the &lt;input&gt; element, but now with the React-controlled value for its value attribute. This way whatever value the user has entered will always be part of a React Component’s state, and so can be manipulated and interacted with in the same manner. And of course, a controlled form might render multiple &lt;input&gt; elements, tracking the values of each one in a separate variable in the state. This also allows the inputs to easily interact with each other, such if you want to confirm that a password was entered correctly twice. Robust form validation is actually quite tricky in React (especially when compared to other frameworks such as Angular). Using an external library such as Formik can help with developing forms and handling all the edge cases. Fetching Data via AJAX One of the most common use of lifecycle callback functions is when accessing data asynchronously, such as when fetching data via an AJAX request (such a described in Chapter 14). This section provides details about how to asynchronously load data within the React framework. First, remember that React code is transpiled using Webpack. As such, some APIs—including fetch() are not “built-in” to React like they are with a modern browser. As discussed in Chapter 14, in order to support these “other” browsers, you will need to load a polyfill. You can do that with React by installing the whatwg-fetch library, and then importing that polyfill in your React code: # On command line, install the polyfill npm install whatwg-fetch //In your JavaScript, import the polyfill (loading it \"globally\") //This will make the `fetch()` function available import 'whatwg-fetch'; Remember that fetch() downloads data asynchronously. Thus if you want to download some data to display, it may take a while to arrive. You don’t want React to have to “wait” for the data (since React is designed to be fast). Thus the best practice is to send the fetch() request for data, and then when the data has been downloaded, call the a set state function to update the component with the downloaded data. (The component can initialize its state as an “empty array” of data). Fetching data from the internet is considered a side effect in React. Function components are supposed to do one thing (as well-designed “pure” functions): they return the DOM that will be rendered on the screen. But downloading data modifies something outside of that framework, in that it modifies network status/information and even the status of the remote server! Thus calling fetch() from directly inside the component function would be considered bad programming style, and can cause problems and bugs when the component is rendered. For example, if the fetched data returns too quickly or too slowly, you may try and set the state variable of (and thus rerender) a component that isn’t yet attached to the DOM, causing React to crash. And if the state does update and reruns the component, that would cause it to download the data yet again, potentially causing an infinite loop! In order to perform side effect operations in React, you need to use another kind of hook called an effect hook, provided by the React function useEffect(). An effect hook lets you hook into the lifecycle of a component, specifying some code (a function) that should be run after the component finishes rendering. Any code that will produce a side effect (such as downloading data, manipulating the DOM outside of React rendering, or setting up subscriptions to a data source) should be run through an effect hook. That’s why they’re called effect hooks: because they define a side effect to the component rendering. An example of using the event hook to download data is below, followed by an explanation of the syntax. //import the hooks used import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function MyComponent() { //store the data in a state variable, initialized as an empty array const [data, setData] = useState([]); //specify the effect hook function useEffect(() => { fetch(dataUri) //send AJAX request .then((res) => res.json()) .then((data) => { let processedData = data.filter(...).map(...) //do desired processing setData(processedData) //change the state and re-render }) }, []) //empty array is the second argument to the `useEffect()` function. //It says to only run this effect on first render //Map the data values into DOM elements //Note that this works even before data is loaded (when the array is empty!) let dataItems = data.map((item) => { return &lt;li key={item.id}>{item.value}&lt;/li>; //return DOM version of datum }) //render the data items (e.g., as a list) return &lt;ul>{dataItems}&lt;/ul>; } } Calling the useEffect() function specifies a callback function that will be run after the component renders. Things to notice about how this function is used: As with the state hook, the effect hook function useEffect must be imported (as a named import). The useEffect() function takes as an argument the callback function to run after the component renders. This is usually specified as an arrow function, though you could of course give it a named function. Note that the callback takes no arguments. Inside the useEffect() callback goes the normal fetch() call. Notice that the downloaded data is then assigned to the component’s state variable by calling the set state function (named setData() in this example). While technically it means the component is rendering twice (once without data, then once with), React can batch these requests together so that if the data downloads fast enough, the user will not notice. This is also a good reason to conditionally include DOM elements like spinners when rendering data. By default, the effect callback will be executed after each time the component renders. That means that if the component needed to re-render (because a prop changed for example), then the data would be downloaded a second time! To avoid this, you can pass the useEffect() function an optional second argument. This argument should be an array of values that the effect “depends on”—the effect will only be re-run if one of these variables changes between renders: //an effect that only re-runs if the `count` variable changes useEffect(() => { //... }, [count]) By passing an empty array as a second argument, you tell the effect that it should only re-run if one of those (non-existent) variables updates—and since there are no variables listed, it will never run a second time! The useEffect() function does not need to return any values. In fact, the only value it can return is a “cleanup” callback function, which React will run whenever the component is removed from the DOM: useEffect(() => { //... return function cleanup() { //function name is arbitrary console.log(\"component has been removed!\") } }) This is only necessary for side effects that require cleanup, such as subscribing to a data source or handling some user authentication behaviors. It is not needed for basic fetch() calls. There are a number of other hooks available in React as well. Check the documentation for details. Note that in general, you should only look into a hook if you’re hitting an architectural problem (e.g., you have a lot of repeated code)—otherwise stick with the basic structure of props and state! Resources Handling Events Using the State Hook props vs state (blog) FAQ: Component State Lifting State Up React Forms Thinking in React Hooks "],["client-side-routing.html", "Chapter 17 Client-Side Routing 17.1 Single-Page Applications 17.2 React-Router Resources", " Chapter 17 Client-Side Routing This chapter discusses how to use React to effectively develop Single Page Applications (SPA)—web applications that are located on a single web page (HTML file), but DOM manipulation (and often AJAX requests) to produce the appearance of multiple “web pages”. This structure is facilitated by the use of the client-side routing library react-router, which allows you to render different Components based on the browser’s URL, allowing each View (“page”) to be treated as a unique resource. 17.1 Single-Page Applications As you’ve seen in previous chapters, the React framework lets you dynamically render different Views (Components) based on different conditions such as the state of the app. For example, you can have a blogging app that could have a blogPostId state variable, and then use that variable to determine which blog post to display. Often these Views act as entirely separate pages—you either show one View or an another. As such, you’d often like each View to be treated as an individual resource and so to have its own URI, thus allowing each View to be referenced individually. For example, each blog post could have it’s own URI, allowing a user to type in a particular URL to see a specific post (and letting that user share the post with others). In order to achieve this effect, you can use client-side routing. With client-side routing, determining which View to display based on the URL (how to “route”, or map that URL to the correct resource) is performed on the client-side by JavaScript code. This is distinct from server-side routing, in that the server isn’t deciding which resource to show (i.e., which .html file to respond to a request with), but rather responds with a single HTML file whose JavaScript dynamically determines what resource to show (i.e., which React component to render) based on the URI that request was sent to! In this context, “routing” involves taking the resource identifier (the URI) and determining what representation of that resource should be displayed—what View to show. A “route” is thus a URI, which will refer to a particular View of the resource. Client-side routing allows you to have unique URLs for each View, but will also make the app work faster—instead of needing to download an entire brand new page from the server, you only need to download the requisite extra data (e.g., using an AJAX request), with much of the other content (the HTML, CSS, etc) already being in place. Moreover, this will all your app to easily share both state data and particular components (e.g., headers, navigation, etc). Google Drive is a good example of a Single-Page Application. Notice how if you navigate to a new folder, the URL changes (so you can link to individual folders), but only a single “pane” of the page changes. Because React applications are component-based, you can perform client-side routing in React by using conditional rendering to only render components if the current route is correct. This follows a structure similar to: function App(props) { //pick a component based on the URL let componentToRender = null; if(currentUrl === '/home'){ //pseudocode comparison with URL componentToRender = &lt;HomePage />; } else if(currentUrl === '/about'){ componentToRender = &lt;AboutPage />; } //render that component return componentToRender; } That is, if the current URL matches a particular route, then the Component will be rendered. 17.2 React-Router Third-party libraries such as React Router provide Components that include this “matching” functionality, allowing you to easily develop single-page applications. This chapter details how to use version 6 of React Router, released in November 2021. This version is significantly different from the previous versions (including v5). Be careful when looking up examples and resources that they’re utilizing the same version as you! For details about earlier versions of the React Router, see the documentation for those versions As with other libraries, you begin using React Router by installing the react-router-dom library (the browser-specific version of React Router): npm install react-router-dom You will then need to import any Components you wish to use into the .js files containing your React code. For example: //import BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, and Link from react-router import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link} from 'react-router-dom' These Components are described in the following sections. Routing The &lt;BrowserRouter&gt; Component (which is often imported with an alias of &lt;Router&gt;—though there is also a &lt;Router&gt; component!) is the “base” Component used by React Router. This Component does all the work of keeping the React app’s UI (e.g., which Components are rendered) in sync with the browser’s URL. The BrowserRouter “listens” for changes to the URL, and then passes information about the current route (called the path) to its child components. This allows each child to always know what route is currently shown in the URL, without needing to access the URL directly. With React Router, a “route” is defined by the path portion of a URI (see Chapter 2). This is the part that comes after the protocol and domain (e.g., after the https://mydomain.com/). Thus the /home route would refer to the URI https://mydomain.com/home, while the /about route would refer to the URI https://mydomain.com/about. BrowserRouter utilizes the HTML5 history API to interact with the brower’s URL and history (what allows you to go “back” and “forward” between URLs). This API is supported by modern browsers, but older browsers (i.e., IE 9) would need to use &lt;HashRouter&gt; as an drop-in alternate. HashRouter uses the fragment identifier portion of the URI to track what “page” the app should be showing, causing URL’s to include an extra hash # symbol in them (e.g., https://mydomain.com/#/about). Your app will only ever have a single &lt;BrowserRouter&gt; component in it–usually at the “top level” of your application (so it would contain &lt;App&gt; as a child). Thus the &lt;BrowserRouter&gt; is usually rendered in the index.html file: //index.js import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom' import App from './components/App.js' //render the App *inside* of the BrowserRouter const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render( &lt;BrowserRouter> &lt;App /> &lt;/BrowserRouter> ); Inside the &lt;BrowserRouter&gt; (usually inside of the &lt;App&gt;), you will define the routes for your application—the collection of supported paths and which View to show at each. You can specify route-based views using the &lt;Route&gt; Component. This component will render its element only when the current URL matches a specified path. In effect, the Route Component handles checking if the current URL matches the specified path, and if so renders its element. If the URL doesn’t match the route, then the element is not rendered. Both the path and the element are passed into the &lt;Route&gt; as props: function App(props) { return ( &lt;Routes> {/* the collection of routes to match */} {/* if currentUrlPath === \"home\" */} &lt;Route path=\"home\" element={&lt;HomePage />} /> {/* if currentUrlPath === \"about\" */} &lt;Route path=\"about\" element={&lt;AboutPage />} /> &lt;/Routes> ); } Points to notice about this example: The path prop is used to indicate the route that you wish to match—in particular, matching to the path part of the URL (after the domain). You do not include http or domain.com in the path. The “root” segment \"/\" is used to match to a URL without a path (e.g., what to show at http://domain.com). Using a wildcard * in the path will match to “anything”, and is good for rendering “Page Not Found” elements. The path can include multiple segments (e.g., assignments/react); however multiple segments usually correspond to nested routes, described below. The Component (View) to render is passed in as the element prop. You instantiate the component using &lt;Component/&gt; syntax, and then that is passed as the inline expression (inside the {}). Yes, it makes the syntax look awkward. You can of course pass additional props to the rendered component as normal: &lt;Route path=\"profile\" element={&lt;ProfilePage user={userData} />} /> While it is possible to pass nested elements as the element property, that can quickly become a readability nightmare. Better practice is to define a single “wrapper” Component to be rendered at the Route. All &lt;Route&gt; elements are made children of a single element called &lt;Routes&gt; (note the s makes it plural!). The &lt;Routes&gt; element represents the “collection” of Routes that the Router needs choose between when deciding what Component to render (if any). You can think of it as acting like a switch statement. In practice, you will have a single &lt;Routes&gt; element in your page, usually in a top-level component such as &lt;App&gt;. Note that a &lt;Routes&gt; can only have &lt;Route&gt; elements as children, and a &lt;Route&gt; element can only be the child of a &lt;Routes&gt;. They go together, and nothing else (no other &lt;div&gt;, etc. elements) can come between them. Though see Nesting Routes before for details on integrating different DOM layouts with your routing. Nesting Routes In the above example, the Route’s path prop corresponds to a single segment of the URI path. Many React apps will want to differentiate the rendered content based on multiple segments. For example: the /user/profile path might show a &lt;UserProfile&gt; component, while the user/favorites path might show a &lt;FavoriteItems&gt; component (with the list of items the user has marked). Yet both of these paths might also want to show content shared by all Views that are part /user paths (but different from other non-user-specific paths, such as the /items path). React Router supports this behavior by nesting routes—having one &lt;Route&gt; element be the child of another. For example: // An example of nested routes &lt;Routes> &lt;Route path=\"user\" element={&lt;UserLayout />} > &lt;Route path=\"profile\" element={&lt;UserProfile />} /> &lt;Route path=\"favorites\" element={&lt;FavoriteItems />} /> &lt;/Route> &lt;Route path=\"items\" element={ &lt;ItemList />} /> &lt;/Routes> When the &lt;Routes&gt; element goes to match a URL and determine which element to render, it will start with with the first segment of the path, rendering that element. For example, if the path starts with /user, then the Router will render the &lt;UserLayout&gt; element. But it will then continue checking further segments of the path: so if the path is /user/profile, then the Router will render the &lt;UserLayout&gt; (for the /user part), but then render the &lt;UserProfile&gt; (for the /profile part) inside of the &lt;UserLayout&gt; at an indicated location. Thus you could view the above Routes as defining the following paths: /user/profile renders &lt;UserLayout&gt;&lt;UserProfile/&gt;&lt;/UserLayout&gt; /user/favorites renders &lt;UserLayout&gt;&lt;UserFavorites/&gt;&lt;/UserLayout&gt; /user renders &lt;UserLayout&gt;&lt;/UserLayout&gt; (no child) /items renders &lt;ItemList /&gt; (You can think of each “nested child” step as a / in the path) You specify where in the parent element the child element will render using an &lt;Outlet&gt; Component. This component will be replaced by the element of whichever child route matches the URL segment: function UserLayout(props) { render ( &lt;div className=\"user-layout\"> &lt;h1>User Page&lt;/h1> {/* will be replaced with &lt;UserProfile>, &lt;UserFavorites>, or null */} &lt;Outlet /> &lt;/div> ) } Thus you can think of the &lt;Outlet /&gt; as the “place the child component will go”. Nested routes are primarily used to create shared layouts, as in the example above. The &lt;UserLayout&gt; component can contain structure elements (like divs) that will be shared across routes that begin with the same segment, but not other routes. Not all apps require nesting routes! If your entire app has a single layout, you don’t need to create a separate Component for that; you can just render it as part of your &lt;App&gt; and use the &lt;Routes&gt; to specify the dynamic content. Similarly, remember that Routes are only for conditionally rendering a Component based on the URI. If you want to conditionally show content (e.g., depending on whether the user is logged in, or based on what item has been selected), you use conditional rendering based on the state—don’t use a Route! If you wish to show a “default” child Component when there is no further segment, you can give the child Route the index prop: &lt;Routes> &lt;Route path=\"user\" element={&lt;UserLayout />} > {/* show the UserHome at ``/user` */} &lt;Route index element={&lt;UserHome />} /> &lt;Route path=\"profile\" element={&lt;UserProfile />} /> &lt;Route path=\"favorites\" element={&lt;FavoriteItems />} /> &lt;/Route> &lt;/Routes> Notice that the index prop (which takes no other values!) in effect “replaces” the path segment for that child. It is often useful to specify the routes as a const variable (e.g., routes) that is an object containing paths and which component to render for that path. You can use the useRoutes() hook to then render this object instead of specifying a &lt;Routes&gt; element. This is only recommended for particularly large applications. You can use the useMatch() hook to get access to the current path; this can be useful for specifying e.g., relative image paths. URL Parameters It is also possible to include variables in the matched route using what are called URL Parameters. As you may recall from reading a RESTful API, URI endpoints are often specified with “variables” written using :param syntax (a colon : followed by the parameter name). For example, the URI https://api.github.com/users/:username from the Github API refers to a particular user—you can replace :username with any value you want: https://api.github.com/users/joelwross refers to the joelwross user (so username = 'joelwross'), while https://api.github.com/users/mkfreeman refers to the mkfreeman user (so username = 'mkfreeman'). React Router supports a similar syntax when specifying Route paths. For example: &lt;Route path='posts/:postId' element={&lt;BlogPost />} /> will match a path that starts with posts/ and is followed by any other path segment (e.g., post/hello, post/2022-10-31, etc). The :postId (because it starts with the leading :) will be treated as a parameter which will be assigned whatever value is part of the URI in that spot—so post/hello would have 'hello' as the postId, and post/2017-10-31 would have '2017-10-31' as the postId. You can access the values assigned to the URL parameters by using the useParams hook provided by react-router. This hook returns an object whose keys are the parameter names and whose values are the param values: import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'; function BlogPost(props) { //access the URL params as an object //it's also common to use object destructuring here const urlParams = useParams(); return ( {/* postId was the URL parameter from the above example! */} &lt;h1>You are looking at blog post {urlParams.postId}&lt;/h1> ) } In the above BlogPost component, the urlParams value will be an object containing different values depending on the route: If the element is rendered by &lt;Route path=\"posts/:postId\" element={&lt;BlogPost /&gt;} /&gt;, then visiting posts/hello will cause urlParams to be the object {postId: \"hello\"} visiting posts/2022-10-31 will cause urlParams to be the object: {postId: \"2022-10-13\"} If the element is rendered by &lt;Route path=\"posts/:date/:title\" element={&lt;BlogPost /&gt;} /&gt;, then visiting posts/2022-10-31/Hello will cause urlParams to be the object {date: \"2022-10-31\", title: \"Hello\"} (note the multiple values for the multiple parameters!) If you want to work with query parameters (e.g., the ?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2 part of the URL), you can use the useSearchParams() hook. This works similar to the useState() hook, except that the value will be stored in the URL query parameter rather than in the Component’s state. Note that query parameters should only be used for values such as search queries that don’t correspond to a consistent resource. Linking While specifying &lt;Route&gt; elements will allow you to show different “pages” at different URLs, in order for a Single Page Application to function you need to be able to navigate between routes without causing the page to reload. Thus you can’t just use normal &lt;a&gt; elements to link between “pages”—browsers interpret clicking on &lt;a&gt; elements as a command to send a new HTTP request, and you instead just want to change the URL and re-render the App. Instead, React Router provides a &lt;Link&gt; element that you can use to create a hyperlink to another route within the application. This component takes a to prop that you use to specify the route that it links to: &lt;Link to=\"about\">Click to visit the About Page&lt;/Link> The component will render as an &lt;a&gt; element with a special onClick handler that keeps the browser from loading a new page. Thus you can specify any content that you would put in the &lt;a&gt; (such as the hyperlink text) as child content of the &lt;Link&gt;. Importantly: a &lt;Link&gt; is a replacement for an &lt;a&gt; element—do not try to put one inside of the other! A to property that is relative path (so doesn’t have a starting /) will resolve relative to its parent route. Thus you can use .. to refer to the parent route as you would with any other relative path. React Router also provides a &lt;NavLink&gt; Component. This works exactly like the &lt;Link&gt; component, except if the to route matches the current route, then the element will have the active CSS class added to it. This is used for example to have a navigation section “highlight” the link to the page you’re currently on, helping the user understand where they are on the page. It’s also possible to specify a callback function if you wish to use a custom name for the “active” class; see the documentation for an example (watch out of the ternary operator). Redirecting In addition to &lt;Link&gt; elements that allow the user to navigate by clicking an element, React Router also provides functionality to programmatically navigate through routes. The primary tool for this is the useNavigate() hook. This hook, when called, will provide a function (conventionally named navigate) that can be called to redirect the App—to change the URL without reloading the page (and thus cause the Routes to re-render): import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'; //A simple form component function Form(props){ const navigate = useNavigate(); //access navigate function //event handler for the form const handleSubmit = function(event) { event.preventDefault(); //do form submission work here navigate(\"/home\") //navigate to the `/home` route } return ( &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> ... &lt;/form> ) } The navigate() function takes an an argument the same stying you would use as the to prop for a &lt;Link&gt; element. You should only use the navigate() function when non-navigation actions (such as form submissions) need to cause redirections. If the user is clicking on an element to navigate, just embed that element in a &lt;Link&gt;—that will keep your page accessible. Additionally, only call navigate() from inside of an event handler; don’t use it in the body of a Compnent function—use a &lt;Navigate&gt; element. Alternatively, you can cause the route to change by rendering a Navigate element. This element accepts a to prop just like a &lt;Link&gt;, and when rendered will redirect the user as if the link were clicked without the user doing anything. To be clear: you need to render the &lt;Navigate&gt; element—to return it from a Component as the DOM to render. So instead of a component returning e.g., &lt;div&gt;, you would have it return a &lt;Navigate&gt;. Thus you would use this element with conditional rendering, using an if statement to determine whether you want to return/show regular DOM content or instead return a &lt;Navigate&gt; to redirect. DO NOT render a &lt;Navigate&gt; as the child of displayed content (e.g., inside a &lt;div&gt;), as this can cause issues with the redirect taking multiple “DOM update cycles” to process, interfering with your application’s processing. Instead, determine whether you should redirect and if so return just the &lt;Navigate&gt; element (e.g., with a “break early” sentinel condition). &lt;Navigate&gt; elements are particular useful when creating “protected routes”—routes that are only accessible under certain conditions (such as if the user is logged in). To do this, you have the Route’s element include an if statement to determine whether it should display content, or if it instead should show the &lt;Navigate&gt; and this redirect: function ProtectedPage(props) { //...determine if user is logged in (eg., via AJAX) if(!userIsLoggedIn) { //if no user, send to sign in return &lt;Navigate to=\"/signin\">; } //otherwise show content return ( &lt;div>protected content!&lt;/div> ) } A nice strategy is to combine the above logic with a nested route, allowing you to re-use authentication logic across your app: function RequireAuth(props) { //...determine if user is logged in (eg., via AJAX) if(!userIsLoggedIn) { //if no user, send to sign in return &lt;Navigate to=\"/signin\">; } else { //otherwise, show the child route content return &lt;Outlet /> } } function App(props) { return ( &lt;Routes> {/* protected routes */} &lt;Route element={&lt;RequireAuth />}> &lt;Route path=\"profile\" element={&lt;ProfilePage />} /> &lt;Route path=\"secret\" element={&lt;SecretPage />} /> &lt;/Route> {/* public routes */} &lt;Route path=\"signin\" element={&lt;SignInPage />} /> &lt;/Routes> ) } The Route rendering the &lt;RequireAuth&gt; has no defined path, defaulting to \"\" (thus not providing a segment to consider). So if its child route are matched, that component will render, and either use the &lt;Navigate&gt; to redirect to a public route, or to show the child route element in place of the &lt;Outlet&gt;. This structure lets you keep your protected routes organized, while keeping all of your “user is logged in” logic in a single location. React Router and Hosting React Router’s client-side routing introduce a few additional considerations when the you wish to deploy your app on a non-development server, such as Github Pages (e.g., what happens when you deploy a create-react-app project). First, consider what happens when you type a route (e.g., https://domain.com/about to access the /about route) into the browser’s URL bar in order to navigate to it. This creates an HTTP Request for the resource at the URI with an /about path. When that request is received by the web server, that server will perform server-side routing and attempt to access the resource at that location (e.g., it will look for an /about/index.html page). But this isn’t what you want to happen—because there is no content at that resource (no /about/index.html), the server will return a 404 error. Instead, you want the server to take the request for the /about resource and instead return your root /index.html page, but with the appropriate JavaScript code which will allow the client-side routing to change the browser’s URL bar and show the content at the /about route. In effect, you want the server to be able to return your root index.html page no matter what route is specified in the HTTP Request! It is perfectly possible to have a web server do this (to not perform server-side routing and instead always return /index.html no matter what resource is requested); indeed, this is what the Create React App development server does. However GitHub Pages doesn’t have this functionality: if you send an HTTP request for a resource that doesn’t exist (e.g., /about), you will receive a 404 error. There are a few ways to work around this: You can use a &lt;HashRouter&gt; instead of a &lt;BrowserRouter&gt; The &lt;HashRouter&gt; uses the fragment identifier portion of the URI to record and track which route the user is viewing: the HTTP request is thus sent to https://domain.com/index.html#/about to get the /about route—and since index.html is the default resource, this can be abbreviated to https://domain.com/#/about, which is almost as good. In this way you are always requesting the appropriate resource (/index.html), but can still perform client-side routing. The trade-off is that your URLs will have extraneous # symbols in them (which also makes utilizing inner-page navigation with the fragment more difficult), and going to domain.com/about will still cause a 404 error. It’s recommend that you avoid this element if possible. Another approach is to replace your server’s 404 page with something that goes to your index.html (using server-side routing)—so instead of the user being shown the 404, they are shown your index.html which is about to do the client-side routing! spa-github-pages provides some boilerplate for doing this with GitHub Pages, but it is a “hacky” approach and so is also not recommended. The best and correct approach is to use a web hosting system that better supports the server-side routing needed for single-page applications. For example, Firebase Hosting allows you to specify a rewrite rule that will cause the server to return your index.html no matter which route the HTTP Request specifies. Create React App provides instructions on deploying to Firebase Hosting, including a simple wizard configuration that allows you to configure your site as a single-page application.

One of the primary reasons we would want to dynamically produce a DOM is if the web page’s content is based on some data that may change over time: for example, the kind of data that is available through a Web API. By using JavaScript to render the DOM, you can quickly produce large amounts of HTML needed to display large data sets, sure that you have up-to-date data each time the page loads, and even automatically refresh the page content without requiring the user to reload! This chapter describes how to use JavaScript to dynamically send HTTP Requests to download data (without reloading the page!), as well as how to perform the asynchronous programming needed when working with web requests and other time-consuming operations. Note that this lecture assumes that you have a basic familiarity with RESTful Web APIS, including how to read and access their endpoints. For a review of some of the terminology used in APIS and RESTful requests, see the INFO 201 course reader. 18.1 AJAX As discussed in Chapter 2, you download data from the Internet by sending an HTTP Request and then processing the response. In everyday usage, HTTP Requests are normally sent by the browser when the user enters a URL or clicks on a link. By default, if you wanted to download new data, you’d need to have the browser send a new request, loading a new page (or reloading the current page) in order to show that result. To make modern dynamic web pages that display new data without needing to refresh the browser, we use a technique to send HTTP Requests from JavaScript code rather than from the browser. This allows us to “by-pass” the browser and get new data (and change the webpage) without reloading it! This technique is referred to as AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)—we write code that sends an “request with AJAX” or an “AJAX request”. Fun fact: The technology used to send AJAX requests was originally developed by Microsoft in the late 90s to support their fledgling web version of the Outlook email/calendar app. The JavaScript functions used to send these requests were included in Internet Explorer as a non-standard feature—an example of a browser adding new functionality that it thinks will be useful but that doesn’t work on other platforms. However, AJAX quickly gained popularity (particularly when Google showed off what you could do with it via Gmail and Google Maps), and has since become a standard that is now supported by all browsers. This is how standards come into existence! XML and JSON AJAX is called “AJAX” because it was originally designed to request data in XML format. XML (EXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language (like HTML) that is used to encode meaning in content in a format that is both human and computer readable. The syntax for XML is exactly the same as HTML: in fact, HTML can be seen as a “subset” of the language. You can think of XML as “HTML, but you get to make up your own element names!” &lt;!-- Some XML encoding information about a person --> &lt;person> &lt;firstName>Alice&lt;/firstName> &lt;lastName>Smith&lt;/lastName> &lt;favorites> &lt;music>jazz&lt;/music> &lt;food>pizza&lt;/food> &lt;numbers> &lt;item>12&lt;/item> &lt;item>42&lt;/item> &lt;/numbers> &lt;/favorites> &lt;/person> The XML language does not define any particular tags the way HTML does; instead it is up to individual applications to determine what tags it will recognize and interpret (and what tags it would see as gibberish)—what is referred to as a XML Schema. At the time AJAX was first developed, XML was the most common way of encoding generic data for transmission. And because XML is a tree of elements just like the DOM, similar methods could be used to navigate and extract information from the tree. However, XML is a very verbose language: it requires a lot of characters to encode information (meaning that the amount of data being transferred is larger), and traversing an element tree requires a lot of code. As such, JavaScript developers (led by Douglas Crockford) developed an alternative language called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) that is more compact than XML and can be directly parsed into JavaScript objects and arrays: { \"firstName\": \"Alice\", \"lastName\": \"Smith\", \"favorites\": { \"music\": \"jazz\", \"food\": \"pizza\", \"numbers\": [12, 42] } } JSON format uses a syntax that is almost identical to that for defining Object literals in JavaScript, with a few key differences: JSON always defines an Object {} at the “top level”. JSON object keys (which must be strings) must be written in double-quotes. JSON values can only be strings, numbers, booleans (true or false), arrays ([]), or other objects. You cannot include a function in JSON. JSON objects and arrays can’t have trailing commas or other extraneous symbols—no comments! The JavaScript language provides a global object JSON (like the global Math object) that can be used to convert from encoded strings of JSON content (e.g., the above code block as a single string variable '{\"firstName\":\"Alice\"}') to JavaScript objects, and vice versa: //convert from Object to encoded String let personObj = {firstName:\"Alice\", lastName:\"Smith\", id:12} //JavaScript object let personString = JSON.stringify(personObj); //turn object into JSON string console.log(personString); //=> '{\"firstName\":\"Alice\",\"lastName\":\"Smith\",\"id\":12}' console.log(typeof personString); //=> 'string' //convert from encoded String to Object let favoritesString = '{\"music\":\"jazz\", \"numbers\":[12,42]}'; //a string, not an object! let favoritesObj = JSON.parse(favoritesString); //turn JSON string into object console.log(favoritesObj); //=> { music: 'jazz', numbers: [ 12, 42 ] } console.log(typeof favoritesObj); //=> 'object' Note that if your JSON string is not properly formatted (e.g., you’re missing a quote), the JSON.parse() function will throw a SyntaxError. The exact error in the JSON string can be hard to find; online tools can help show the problem. JSON has replaced XML as the encoding of choice for working with AJAX requests—however, the technique is still referred as “AJAX” (“AJAJ” isn’t as easy to say!) 18.2 Fetching Data AJAX support is built into browsers through the included XMLHttpRequest global variable (the “xml http thing”). This object provides functions that allow you to send an HTTP request to the server, but the object’s API is really complex to use: An example XMLHTTPRequest //create a new XMLHttpRequest object let request = new XMLHttpRequest(); //configure it to do an HTTP GET request for some URL request.open('GET', 'https://domain.com/data', true); //add a listener for the \"load\" event (when the data has been downloaded) request.addEventListener('load', function() { if (request.status >= 200 &amp;&amp; request.status &lt; 400) { //check response status let data = JSON.parse(request.responseText); console.log(data); //do something with the data } }); //listen for \"error\" events if there was a network error request.addEventListener('error', function() { //handle error... }) //finally, send the request to the server! request.send(); Instead of needing to understand all that code, developers tended to use functions from external libraries such as jQuery’s $.getJSON() or $.ajax(): $.getJSON('https://domain.com/data', function(data) { //`data` is the already-parsed JSON data console.log(data); //do something with the data }); But this requires including the jQuery library in your page, and since the need for jQuery is rapidly going away, other options are now built in to modern browsers. In particular, we will utilize the fetch() API to easily send AJAX requests for data! fetch() is an recent standard, so that it is not supported by older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer. However, we can still use fetch() with these browsers by including a polyfill—an external library that replicates an existing API in platforms that don’t support it! The fetch() polyfill will provide a fetch() function to browsers that don’t provide it (leaving other browsers unchanged) that uses the existing XMLHttpRequest without you needing to interact with that object. It’s easiest to just load the polyfill from a CDN: &lt;!-- put this BEFORE your own script! --> &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fetch/2.0.3/fetch.min.js\">&lt;/script> The fetch() function makes it easy to send a request: simply call it and pass in the URL of the data you wish to download: fetch('https://domain.com/data'); In some browsers, you will not be able to send an AJAX request when the web page is loading via the file:// protocol (e.g., by double-clicking on the .html file). This is a security feature to keep you from accidentally running an HTML file that contains malicious JavaScript that will download a virus onto your computer. Instead, you should run a local web server such as live-server for testing AJAX requests. Remember to always use a relative path when specifying what file or API you wish to fetch. Moreover, paths are always relative to the .html file that the user is currently viewing, not to the .js file that contains the fetch() call. So be careful if your JavaScript is in a different folder; the path needs to be relative to the HTML (which should be in the root of your project). 18.3 Asynchronous Programming However, the fetch() function does NOT directly return the data you want to download! Downloading data off the internet can take a long time: the network connection may be slow and the amount of data to download may be quite large (metadata for the latest 100 tweets from Twitter involves almost 500k of JSON content). Because fetching data may take time, AJAX requests are made asynchronously (that’s the “A” in AJAX)—the download will occur at the same time that the rest of the code is being executed. Thus the download and the remaining script will not be synchronized; they will be “asynchronous”. console.log('About to send request'); //statement 1 //send request for data to the url fetch(url); //statement 2 console.log('Sent request'); //statement 3 //The data is actually received sometime later, //when the JS interpreter is down here! In the above example, the JS interpreter will execute statement 1, then statement 2 (the fetch() call). It will then precede immediately to statement 3 (the second console.log), without waiting for the request to finish! The download will continue to occur in the background, and will finish at some point later in the program—though we don’t know exactly when. It is best to think of fetch() as a function that will just “start to download data”, not one that actually downloads data! Because fetch() is an asynchronous function (it’s code is run asynchronously), it returns what is called a Promise. A Promise is object that holds a value which may not be available yet—you can think of a Promise as like a placeholder where the result of the asynchronous function call will eventually be stored (it is a “promise” to eventually have some data, though that promise may be kept or broken!). Promises are the modern way of handling asynchronous functions, but as part of the ES6 standard they are not yet available to all browsers (specifically: Internet Explorer). So you’ll need to include another polyfill to support IE. This is also available from a CDN. Promises have three possible states: pending (the data is downloading), fulfilled (the data has finished downloading), or rejected (the data failed to download and the promise was “broken”). We are able to specify callback functions (similar to event listeners) that occur when a pending Promise is either successfully fulfilled or has been rejected. The “on success” callback function is specified by calling the .then() function on the Promise object, and passing the “on success callback” as a parameter: function onSuccessCallback(response) { //what to do when we get the response console.log(response); } //When fulfilled, execute the callback function (which will be passed the response) let promise = fetch(url); promise.then(onSuccessCallback); //It is much more common to use anonymous variables/callbacks: fetch(url).then(function(response) { console.log(response); }); The “on success” callback will be passed a single parameter: the data value that the Promise was made for (e.g., the data that will eventually be downloaded from fetch()). So when the callback is executed, you will have access to the data! For example, when the fetch() Promise is fulfilled, it will pass an object representing the response to the HTTP Request: let promise = fetch(url); promise.then(function(response){ console.log( response.url ); //a string of where the request was sent console.log( response.status ); //the HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404) }); This response object does have a body property that represents the “body” (data content) of the HTTP response. However, that body stored as a “stream” of 0s and 1s, not as a JavaScript object (or even a string you can JSON.parse())! In order to get the body into a format you can use, you will need to “encode” it into a JavaScript object by calling the .json() method on it. There is also an equivalent .text() method to encode a response body into plain text. Chaining Promises But there’s a catch: the “encoding” process performed by the .json() might take some time (particularly for a large amount of data). So instead of blocking (pausing) the rest of your program while that encoding occurs, the .json() method returns another Promise as a placeholder for when the encoded body is available! So you will then need to specify a .then() callback for that Promise as well. However, a Promise’s .then() function has a neat property that makes this easy to do. Calling the .then() function on a Promise returns a new Promise as a placeholder for any data produced by the .then() function. This promised data will be whatever value is returned by the “on success” callback function. This allows you to in effect “chain” .then() calls together, each of which can perform some kind of transformation on the data: function makeQuestion(dataString) { //a function to make a string a question return dataString + '???'; } //image a hypothetical asynchronous function `getAsyncString` //it returns a Promise (placeholder) for a string load from a given source let originalPromise = getAsyncString(myDataSource); //when the original promise is fulfilled, call `makeQuestion` on it //`questionPromise` will be a placeholder for that transformed data let questionPromise = originalPromise.then(makeQuestion); //when the `questionPromise` is fulfilled, call an anonymous callback on it //the callback will be passed the transformed (\"question\") data questionPromise.then(function(data){ console.log(data); //data will be a question! }) More commonly, we use anonymous variables for subsequent promises, allowing you to chain them together in a way that almost reads like English! getAsyncString() .then(makeQuestion) .then(function(data){ console.log(data); }); But wait there’s more! .then() also has a special feature where if the “on success” callback function returns a Promise (rather than another kind of value), then the “outer” promise will take on the state of that new returned Promise. This means that you can just return a Promise from inside a .then() callback, and that Promise will be the subject of the subsequent .then() call: let outerPromise = getAsyncString(myFirstSource).then(function(firstData){ //do something with `firstData` let newPromise = getAsyncString(mySecondSource); //a second async call! return newPromise; //return the promise. }); //`outerPromise` now takes on the state and data of `newPromise` outerPromise.then(function(secondData){ //do something with `secondData`, the data downloaded from `mySecondSource` }); Going back to fetch() to bring it all together: since the .json() encoding function returns a Promise, you can simply return that Promise from the .then() callback in order to make it available to subsequent .then() calls! fetch(url) //start the download .then(function(response) { //when done downloading let dataPromise = response.json(); //start encoding into an object return dataPromise; //hand this Promise up }) .then(function(data) { //when done encoding //do something with the data!! console.log(data); //will now be encoded as a JavaScript object! }); This code example will allow you to download data and encode it into a plain old JavaScript object that you can work with. Handling Errors When downloading data from the internet, it is always possible that the HTTP request may fail. The request may be sent to the wrong URL, the client computer may be having connection problems, or the receiving server may be having problems. In order to deal with inevitable errors, Promises provide a .catch() method that is used to specify a callback that should occur if the Promise is rejected (an error occurs). This callback function will be passed an Error object that contains details about the error. fetch(url) .then(function(response) { //when done downloading return response.json(); //second promise is anonymous }) .then(function(data) { //when done encoding //do something with the data!! console.log(data); //will now be encoded as a JavaScript object! }) .catch(function(err) { //do something with the error console.error(err); //e.g., show in the console }); Importantly, the .catch() method will “catch” errors from all previous Promises in a .then() chain! This means that the above .catch() will show both errors in the downloading (.fetch()), and errors in the body encoding (.json()). You will almost always want to show the error to the user in some way, such as by creating an alert element in the DOM. The .catch() function also returns a Promise, so you can continue to chain .then() calls after it. These later callbacks will only be executed if no previous Promise has been rejected (that is, there haven’t been any errors yet). Important: a Promise will only be rejected if there is an actual “Error” in sending the request. If the server replies with a 401 error (e.g., you didn’t have permission to access the resource) or just the message “invalid API key”, that won’t be handled by .catch(). From JavaScript’s perspective, the request went through perfectly—it’s not fetch’s fault that the data you asked for wasn’t what you actually wanted! You can use the response.status and response.ok properties to check the status of the HTTP response. As such, you will want to make sure to handle things like bad responses or unexpected response bodies, both in testing your application (to make sure the request is sent to the correct URL) and when handling any user input. Other Data Formats The above usage of fetch() works well for data formatted in JSON (which is the most common format for web-accessible data). However, you may wish to dynamically load data that is presented in a different format, such as plain text or as comma-separated values (CSV). There are a few ways to support this: For downloading plain text formatted data, you can use the fetch() method as above, but instead of calling .json() on the response to encode it as a JavaScript object, you can call the .text() method to encode it as a basic string: fetch(url) //start the download .then(function(response) { //when done downloading let dataPromise = response.text(); //start encoding into a String return dataPromise; //hand this Promise up }) .then(function(text) { //when done encoding //do something with the text data!! console.log(text); //will now be encoded as a JavaScript string! }); Encoding as text will support any plaintext formated data—whether from a .txt file, a .csv file, or even a .json or .js file! In fact, if you encode JSON data as plain text using the .text() method, you could then explicitly parse that into a JavaScript Object by using the built-in JSON.parse() function described above! While the .text() method will you encode data into a JavaScript String, that String will often have a particular format that needs to be parsed (interpreted) in order to make the data useful. For example, a String in CSV format is not very useful on its own; you would need to parse it into an array of objects (where each object represents a row) to analyze the data. It is possible (but complex) to do this parsing using built-in String functions (assuming your CSV data matches official standards), but in general it’s easier and more effective to use an external library to do this parsing. One of the best libraries for doing this work is d3.dsv(), a component of the d3 visualization library. d3.fetch() provides convenience wrapper functions for fetch() that also perform effective data parsing. In order to use d3.fetch(), you will need to load it as an external library: &lt;script src=\"https://d3js.org/d3-dsv.v1.min.js\">&lt;/script> &lt;script src=\"https://d3js.org/d3-fetch.v1.min.js\">&lt;/script> (More details coming soon…) Resources An Introduction to AJAX for Front-End Developers (tuts+) An Introduction to fetch() (Google) JavaScript Promises: an Introduction (Google) "],["firebase.html", "Chapter 19 Firebase 19.1 Setting up Firebase 19.2 Realtime Database 19.3 User Authentication Resources", " Chapter 19 Firebase This chapter discusses how to integrate and use the Firebase web service in a client-side application (using React). Firebase is a web service that provides tools and infrastructure for use in creating web and mobile apps that store data online in the cloud (a “web backend solution”). In effect, Firebase acts as a server that can host information for you, so that you can just build client-side applications without needing to program a web server. Firebase is owned and maintained by Google, but will still work perfectly fine with Facebook’s React framework. In particular, this chapter will discuss two features of Firebase: The Firebase service also provide a number of “database” systems. This chapter describes how to use the realtime database, which provides a simple NoSql-style database: you can think of it as a single giant JSON object in the Cloud. Firebase provides methods that can be used to refer to this object and its properties, make changes to the object. Most importantly, it provides the ability to “listen” for changes made by others so that the page can automatically update based on actions taken by other users. In effect you can create a data binding between clients and the server, so that if you update data on one machine, that change automatically appears on another. Firebase also offers additional database structures. Firestore is another NoSQL (document-based) database, but focused more on one-time data fetch queries rather than the continuous data binding provided by the realtime database. Firebase Storgae is used for storing larger data elements (anything that can’t be defined in JSON), such as images or videos. This chapter focuses on the Realtime Database as an easier-to-learn system and to practice data binding. The Firebase service also offers a client-side based system for performing user authentication, or allowing users to “sign in” to your application and have particular information associated with them. It’s possible to have users sign up with an email and password, or even using an external service (e.g., “sign in with Google”). Firebase also provides a way to manage all those extra interactions associated with accounts, like being able to reset passwords or confirm email addresses. And this is all performed securely from the client-side, without the need to set up an additional server to perform OAuth work. These features mean that Firebase can be a go-to back-end for producing a client-side app that involves persisted data (like user accounts). And its free service tier is perfectly suited for any development app. This chapter details how to use version 9+ of the Firebase library, released in August 2021—and in particular it’s modular API (which allows for smaller and more efficient bundles when using webpack and React). Note that while this version is conceptually the same as previous versions, the module syntax for calling and importing functions is different. See the upgrade guide for details. Be careful when looking up examples and resources that they’re use the same version as you! Note that Firebase also provides Firebase Hosting for hosting and serving web applications. This is particularly useful for hosting single-page-applications, such as those built with React Router. Hosting does not require any modifications to your source code, so is not discussed here. 19.1 Setting up Firebase Because Firebase is a cloud service, you will need to set it up externally in order to use it in your web application. Firebase setup and configuration is handled on Firebase’s website at https://firebase.google.com/, and in particular in the Firebase Web Console where you can manage individual projects. When developing a Firebase app, keep the Web Console open all the time so you can check on database, user list, etc! Creating a Project In order to use Firebase in your web app, you will need to sign up for the service. Visit https://firebase.google.com/ and click the “Get Started” button to do so. You will need to sign in with a Google account (e.g., a UW account if you’ve set up Google integration). Signing up will direct you to the Firebase Web Console. In the Web Console, you can manage all of your “projects”—one per application you’ve created (think: per repository). Each project will track its own database of information, its own set of users, etc. You can create a project by clicking the “Add Project” button. On the next screen, you’ll need to give the app a unique name. Naming the project after your app is a good idea. This name is used internally by the Firebase syste; it won’t necessarily be visible to your users, though if you use Firebase Hosting then the project name will be part of the default URL for the application. Recommendation: do not enable Google Analytics for your projects! Once you’ve created the project, you will be taken to the Web Console for that project. This is a web page where you will be able to manage the configuration of the project, the users who have signed up, and any data in the database. In particular, note the navigation menu on the left-hand side: you will use this to access different parts of your project (Realtime Database to manage the database, and Authentication to manage users). Firebase navigation menu Including Firebase in React In order to use Firebase in a web app (including a React app), you will need to add the Firebase library to your web page, as well as some specify some configuration data to connect to the correct Firebase project. From the project’s Web Console page, click the button (it look like a &lt;/&gt; in the above image) to add Firebase to a web app. This will take you to a new page where you’ll need to put in a nickname for the app and then present some JavaScript code for loading the Firebase library (make sure that “Use npm” is selected—you don’t want to include a &lt;script&gt; element!). In a React app you you will integrate Firebase directly into your source code by modifying the index.js file: First, install and Firebase library using npm: # Note: do this in your app's repo (the folder with the `package.json` file) npm install firebase Then, copy the provided import statement, firebaseConfig variable, and initializeApp() function call into your index.js file. This will specify which Firebase project your web app should connect to whenver you call functions to access Firebase. Note that you will need to paste this code before the call ReactDOM.render(). The index.js file will often contain such configuration data that is relevant to the app rather than to a specific component. 19.2 Realtime Database The Firebase web service provides a realtime database for storing and accessing data in the cloud. You can think of this database as being a single giant JSON object in the Cloud that can be simultaneously accessed and modified by multiple clients—and since each client reads the same database, changes made by one user will be seen by others as real-time updates. For example, you might have a database that is structured like: { \"people\" : { \"amit\" : { \"age\" : 35, \"petName\" : \"Spot\" }, \"sarah\" : { \"age\" : 42, \"petName\" : \"Rover\" }, \"zhang\" : { \"age\" : 13, \"petName\" : \"Fluffy\" } } } This database object has a people key that refers to an object, which itself contains keys that refer to individual “person” objects (each of which has an age and petName property). In the Firebase Web Console (under the “Database” tab in the navigation menu), this data structure would be presented as: A Firebase database with sample people data Note that in the Firebase Web Console you can edit this database directly: viewing, adding, editing, and deleting elements in the JSON. This is useful for debugging—both to check that your code is editing the database accurately, and to clean up any mistakes. Although the JSON database can have many levels of nested objects, best practice is to try and keep the structure as “flat” as possible and avoid nesting too much data. This avoids you needing to download the nested “details” for a value if you only need to know e.g., the key names. See Structure Your Data for more details and examples. Setting Up the Database In order to enable the realtime database for your project, navigate to the console page for the database and click the “Create Database” button. Make sure you’re creating the Realtime Database, not the Firestore Database! After selecting your local region, you’ll be prompted to set up the Security Rules. Choose to start in test mode to get started immediately; see the below section for more about security rules. Security Rules Because the Firebase database is just a giant JSON object in the cloud and is usable from a client-side system, technically anyone can access it. Each element of the JSON object is accessible via AJAX requests (which are sent via firebase functions). In order to restrict what clients and access this information (read or write to values in the JSON), Firebase lets you define security rules that specify what users can access which elements. For example, you can make it so that only authenticated users can add new entries the database, or that only specific users can update specific entries (e.g., the comments they wrote on a blog). By default, no one can access or modify the data (in locked mode). If you choose to start your project in test mode, then anyone will be able to access or modify for a limited amount of time. In order to modify or configure the security rules, navigate to the “Rules” tab of the Realtime Database’s page in the Firebase Web Console. You can modify the rules by editing the presented JSON data; remember to hit “Publish” after you’re done editing. Firebase Security Rules are defined in JSON using a particular (and somewhat awkard) scheme. Basically, inside the \"rules\" property you specify a JSON tree that mirrors the structure of your database. But instead of having a value for the keys in your database, you specify an object with \".read\" and \".write\" properties. The values of these properties are boolean expressions that state whether or not the current user is able to read (access) or write (modify) that value. For more on writing rules, such as how to handle user authorization (only certain users can read/write access) or data validation (making sure all data is written of a certain type), see the official documentation. Data References To start working with your database, you will need to get a reference to that value in the database. You begin by getting a reference to the database itself, using the getDatabase() function provided by Firebase’s database module firebase/database: //import the function from the realtime database module import { getDatabase } from 'firebase/database'; // Get a reference to the database service const db = getDatabase(); Importantly, the db value in the example is not a copy of the data or even the database itself! It’s instead just a reference pointer to where that database lives—you can think of it more like a “URL” for the database. In order to modify any particular values in the database, you will need to get a reference to that value. This is done by using the ref() function, passing in the database reference and the “path” (a string) to the data value in the database’s JSON: import { getDatabase, ref } from 'firebase/database'; //get a reference to the database service const db = getDatabase(); //get reference to the \"people\"\" property in the database const peopleRef = ref(db, \"people\") //get reference to the \"sarah\" property inside the \"people\" property in the database //similar to `database.people.sarah` using dot notation const sarahRef = ref(db, \"people/sarah\"); Again, these reference are not the data! They are just reference pointers to where the data lives—like the “URL” for that data value. The “path” to nested values in the database are written in a URI-style “path notation”, where each nested key is indicated by a slash / (rather than the . in dot notation as you’d normally use). Thus \"people/sarah\" refers to the sarah key inside of the people key inside of the database; \"people/sarah/pet\" refers to the pet key inside the sarah key inside the people key—the spot in the database with the value \"Rover\" in the above example. Since this path is just a string, you can use string concatenation to construct the path to a particular value you wish to reference (e.g., if you only want to work with the value for a particular person): //variable name to access const personName = \"Ada\"; //access the \"ada\" property inside of the \"people\" property inside the database const personOfInterestRef = ref(db, \"people/\"+personName); Alternatively, you can use the child() function to get a reference to a specific “child” element in the database: import { ref, child } from 'firebase/database'; //equivalent to the above example //get reference to the \"people\" property in the database const peopleRef = ref(db, \"people\") //get reference to the \"sarah\" property inside of the \"people\" reference'd value const sarahRef = child(peopleRef, \"sarah\") In general, you want to work with a small a subset the data as possible. Thus it’s better to get a reference to \"person/sarah\" if you’re only going to read or write to that value, rather than get a reference to the whole \"people\" and then just read/write the sarah key in that. Writing Data You can modify values in the database by using the set() function. This function takes two arguments: a database reference, and then the new value you want to assign to that location in the database: //alias the `set` function as `firebaseSet` import { ref, set as firebaseSet } from 'firebase/database' //get a reference to where sarah's age is stored in the database const sarahAgeRef = ref(db, \"people/sarah/age\"); //change Sarah's age to 43 (happy birthday!) const newValueForSarahAge = 43; //assign the new value in the database firebaseSet(sarahRef, newValueForSarahAge); This will change the value in the database at \"people/sarah/age\" to 43. Note that in this example, I have use the as keyword to alias the set function when importing it, instead calling it firebaseSet. This is for clarity, as “set” is an overly generic name for a function. Note that as with normal JSON objects, you can also “set” values for database entries that didn’t previously exist—you do not have to “declare” a value in the database ahead of time //a reference to the people entry in the database const peopleRef = ref(db, \"people\") //a reference to a location with no currently defined value const adaRef = ref(peopleRef, \"ada\"); //set an object to that location in the database firebaseSet(adaRef, {age: \"206\", pet: \"Charlie\"}) Finally, note that the set() method returns a Promise. This you can use .then() (or await) to execute statements after the database has updated, and you can thus catch any errors that may occur when attempting to update a value. This is especially useful for debugging, but also is good for providing user feedback. const sarahPetRef = ref(db, \"people/sarah/pet\"); //change Sarah's pet firebaseSet(sarahPetRef, \"Sparky\") .then(() => console.log(\"data saved successfully!\")) .catch(err => console.log(err)); //log any errors for debugging Listening for Data Changes Because Firebase’s database is intended for realtime access (that may change over time), you read data from it and establish data binding by registering an event listener to listen for changes to that database. In effect any modifications to the data causes a “database change event” which triggers your listener, allowing you to acccess the new updated data. You register a database change listener by using the onValue() function. This function takes as arguments a database reference (which value you want to listen for changes to) and a callback function that will be executed in response to the event (similar to the DOM’s addEventListener() function): import { ref, onValue } from \"firebase/database\" //get a reference to a particular value location in the database const amitRef = ref(db, 'people/amit'); //register a listener for changes to that value location onValue(amitRef, (snapshot) => { const amitValue = snapshot.val(); console.log(amitValue); //=> e.g., { age: 35, petName: \"Spot\" } //can do something else with amitValue (e.g., assign to a state variable) }); The callback function will be passed as a parameter the latest snapshot of the data value at the listening location. This is a wrapper around the database’s JSON tree (allowing you to navigate it e.g., with child()). Most commonly, you will want to convert the snapshot into an actual JavaScript object by calling the .val() method on it. The listener will trigger whenever any child node of the targeted refence location changes. Thus even if just people/amit/pet is updated, the above listener will trigger. Importantly, because this listener involves network access and can trigger throughout the life of your application, in a React app you will need to register the listener inside an effect hook. The effect hook’s “cleanup function” will also need to remove the listener—otherwise you will have a memory leak and errors if your component gets removed (e.g., by changing routes). The onValue() function returns a new function that can be used to “unregister” the listener: function MyComponent(props) { //effect hook useEffect(() => { const db = getDatabase(); const amitRef = ref(db, \"people/amit\"); //returns a function that will \"unregister\" (turn off) the listener const unregisterFunction = onValue(amitRef, (snapshot) => { const amitValue = snapshot.val(); //...set state variable, etc... }) //cleanup function for when component is removed function cleanup() { unregisterFunction(); //call the unregister function } return cleanup; //effect hook callback returns the cleanup function }) } Note that it is possble to read a single value once (without needing to register a listener) by using the get() method. This method returns a promise that will contain the read snapshot (once it is download). However, the Realtime Database is intended and optimized for data binding and notifications. Thus you should pretty much always be using onValue() to read data from the database. If you find yourself wanting to just read a single value once, you’re not thinking about Firebase correctly! Firebase Arrays When working with and storing data in the cloud, we often want to organize that data into lists using arrays. However, Firebase does not directly support support arrays: the JSON object in the sky only contains objects, not arrays! This is because Firebase needs to support concurrent access: multiple people need to be able to access the data at the same time. But since arrays are accessed by index, this can cause problems if two people try to modify the array at the same time. The problem is that with an array, an index number doesn’t always refer to the same element! For example, if you have an array ['a', 'b' 'c'], then index 1 may initially refer to the 'b'. However, if you add an element onto the beginning of the array, then suddenly that 1 index refers to the 'a'. And so if a user was trying to modify the 'b' before their machine was aware of the change, they may end up editing the wrong value! This bug is an example of a race condition, which can occur when two processes are modifying data concurrently (at the same time). To avoid this problem, Firebase treats all data structures as Objects, so that each value in the JSON tree has a unique key. That way each client will always be modifying the value they expect. However, Firebase does offer a way that you can treat Objects as arrays, in the form of a push()(https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.Reference#push) function that will add a value to an object with an auto-generated key. import { getDatabase, ref, push as firebasePush } from 'firebase/database'; const db = getDatabase; const tasksRef = ref(db, \"tasks\"); //an object of tasks firebasePush(taskRef, {description:'First things first'} ) //add one task firebasePush(taskRef, {description:'Next things next'} ) //add another task This will produce a database with a structure: { \"tasks\" : { \"-KyxgJhKOVeAj2ibPxrO\" : { \"description\" : \"First things first\" }, \"-KyxgMDJueu17348NxDF\" : { \"description\" : \"Next things next\" } } } Notice how the tasks property is an Object (even though we “pushed” elements into it), and each “task” is assigned an auto-generated key (based on the timestamp it was pushed). You would thus still be able to interact with tasks as if it were an array, but instead of using a value from 0 to length as the index, you’ll use a generated “key” as the index. Always use the push() function to have Firebase automatically manage data arrays for you. Never try to manually create an “array” by giving values keys “0”, “1”, “2” etc. Firebase snapshots do support a forEach() function that you can use to iterate through their elements, allowing you to loop through the elements in an array. However, if you want to do something more complex (like map(), filter(), or reduce()), you need an actual array. The best way to get this is use call Objects.keys() on the snapshot.val() in order to get an array of the keys, and then you can iterate/map those (accessing each element in the “array” using bracket notation). //`tasksSnapshot` is a snapshot of the `tasks` \"array\" const allTasksObject = tasksSnapshot.val(); //convert snapshot to value //an array of the keys in the object [\"-KyxgJhKOVeAj2ibPxrO\", \"-KyxgMDJueu17348NxDF\"] const allTasksKeys = Object.keys(allTasksObject); //map array of keys into array of tasks const allTasksArray = allTasksKeys.map((key) => { const singleTaskCopy = {...allTasksObject[key]}; //copy element at that key singleTaskCopy.key = key; //save the key string as an \"id\" for later return singleTaskCopy; //the transformed object to store in the array }); allTasksArray.map((taskObject) => { ... }) Note that when looping through an “array”, each element is treated handled separately from its key (the same way that a forEach() loop lets you work with array elements separately from their index). But since you need that key as an identifier in order to ref() and modify the JSON element later, you will need to make sure that you “save” the key in the object as you processing it. Don’t lose your key!. 19.3 User Authentication Firebase provides the ability to authenticate users: to let people sign up for you application and then to check that they are who they say (e.g., have provided the right password). Firebase supports multiple different forms of authentication: users can sign up with an email and password, log in with a social media service such as Google or Facebook, or even authenticate “anonymously” (so you can at least keep track of different people even if you don’t know who they are). In order to support user authentication, you will need to enable this feature in the Firebase Web Console. Click on the “Authentication” link in the side navigation menu to go to the authentication management page, then choose “Get started”. Under the “Sign-In Method” tab, you can choose what forms of authentication you wish to enable. For example, click on the “Email/Password” option, and then flip the switch to “Enable” that method. Be sure and Save your changes! Note that you will be able to use this page to see and manage users who have signed up with your Firebase project. This is where you can see if uses have successfully been created, look up their User UID for debugging, or delete users from the project: Firebase users as presented in the authentication web console Signing In with FirebaseUI It is possible to call functions provided by Firebase in order to create and log in users. However, this would require you to implement the “log in form” on your own—and would only easily support the Email/Password authentication option. Instead, a nicer approach is to use the FireabaseUI library, also managed by Firebase. This library provides a set of predefined UI elements like a “login form”, including ones which will support different authentication methods. Example of FirebaseUI authentication There are different FirebaseUI libraries for different platforms; for React you would use firebaseui-web-react. This is an external library (just like react-router), so needs to be installed separately: npm install react-firebaseui The React FirebaseUI library provides a Component called &lt;StyledFirebaseAuth&gt;, which you can render in your page like any other Component. You can think of this Component as the “login form”. A complete example of how this Component is used can be found below, following by an explanation. //import auth functions and variables from Firebase import { getAuth, EmailAuthProvider, GoogleAuthProvider } from 'firebase/auth' //import the component import StyledFirebaseAuth from 'react-firebaseui/StyledFirebaseAuth'; //an object of configuration values const firebaseUIConfig = { signInOptions: [ //array of sign in options supported //array can include just \"Provider IDs\", or objects with the IDs and options GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID, { provider: EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID, requiredDisplayName: true }, ], signInFlow: 'popup', //don't redirect to authenticate credentialHelper: 'none', //don't show the email account chooser callbacks: { //\"lifecycle\" callbacks signInSuccessWithAuthResult: () => { return false; //don't redirect after authentication } } } //the React compnent to render function MySignInScreen() { const auth = getAuth(); //access the \"authenticator\" return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>My App&lt;/h1> &lt;p>Please sign-in:&lt;/p> &lt;StyledFirebaseAuth uiConfig={firebaseUIConfig} firebaseAuth={auth} /> &lt;/div> ); } There are a few steps to using this Component: The &lt;StyledFirebaseAuth&gt; requires a uiConfig prop, which is an object containing configuration values for that login form (the object has specific properties which correspond to configuratoin options). The config object is usually defined as a global constant. The most important configuration option is the signInOptions, listing the different authentication providers supported (what options should show up in the login form). The IDs for these providers are imported from the 'firebase/auth' library—though they are numeric values, not functions Other common/useful options are shown in the example; for a complete list of options see the firebaseui-web documentation. The &lt;StyledFirebaseAuth&gt; also requires a firebaseAuth prop, which is a reference to the “authenticator” service—what will handle the process of the user logging in and out. You can get access to this value via the getAuth() function provided by 'firebase/auth' (similar to how you get access to the Realtime Database via the getDatabase() function). Note that the authenticator is a singleton value—you can call getAuth() from multiple modules/files without concern. You do not need to pass it around as a prop. With this Component, users will be able to “log in”, though see the Managing the User section below. You will be able to see a list of users who have connected to your app in the Firebase Web Console. Note in particular that you can see their uid (unique identifier), which is what is used to distinguish between users. (You can’t use emails as identifiers, because someone who logs in with Facebook won’t provide their email address!). Pro-tip: You don’t need to come up with real email addresses for testing. Try using a@a.com, b@a.com, c@a.com, etc. Similarly, password works fine for testing passwords (though you should never do that in real life!) The Firebase Web Console will provide a view of the “user database”—but importantly, this is not the same as the Realtime Database. The user database holds very limited information: the authentication provider, a “display name”, and possibly a “photo url” (e.g., where to find an avatar image). But you cannot store any additional information in the “user database”—not profile images, not preferred names or pronouns used, not favorite fish. Any user-specific information will need to be stored in the Realtime Database instead, usually using a “key” that is the user’s uid. For example, your Realtime Database might store information like: { \"userData\" : { \"c9PGijn9Snh2YfPA30Hq0t7jn\" : { \"pronouns\" : \"they/them\", \"favoriteFish\" : \"sea bass\" }, \"Tq8t7ETw54XXiWf7XZdnu0J\" : { \"pronouns\" : \"he/him\", \"favoriteFish\" : \"cuttle fish\" } } } You would then access this data using the same process as any other data in the realtime database, listening to the reference \"userData/\"+userId. In order to sign out a user, you will need to use a built-in Firebase function: signOut(): import { getAuth, signOut } from 'firebase/auth'; const auth = getAuth(); signOut(auth) .catch(err => console.log(err)); //log any errors for debugging Note that the signOut() method returns a Promise, so you can .catch() and display any errors. Managing the User Although FirebaseUI will log in a user, you will need to do further work in order for your app to know who that logged in user is. The authenticator (from getAuth()) will keep track of which Firebase User is currently logged in—and this information persists even after the browser is closed. This means that every time you reload the page, the authenticator will automatically perform the authentication and “re-login” the user. The recommended way to determine who is currently logged in is to register an event listener to listen for events that occur with the “state” of the authentication changes (e.g., a user logs in or logs out). This event will occur when the page first loads and Firebase determines that a user has previously signed up (the “initial state” is set), or when a user logs out. You can register this listener by using the onAuthStateChanged() function: //import functions import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth' const auth = getAuth(); onAuthStateChanged(auth, (firebaseUser) => { if(firebaseUser){ //firebaseUser defined: is logged in console.log('logged in', firebaseUser.displayName); //do something with firebaseUser (e.g. assign to a state variable) } else { //firebaseUser is undefined: is not logged in console.log('logged out'); } }); The function takes in two arguments: the authenticator, and a callback function that will be executed whenever the “authentication state” changes (e.g., whenever the user logs in or out). The callback function will be passed an object representing the “Firebase User”. This object contains properties about the user, including: uid, which is the unique id for the user displayName, which is the user’s provider-independent displayable name The most common practice is to take this passed in object and assign it to a more global variable, such as a state variable in a React function (e.g., setCurrentUser(firebaseUser)). If the user “logged out”, then the passed in firebaseUser value will be null. Importantly, because this listener involves network access and can trigger throughout the life of your application, in a React app you will need to register the listener inside an effect hook. The effect hook’s “cleanup function” will also need to remove the listener. The onAuthStateChanged() function returns a new function that can be used to “unregister” the listener: function MyComponent(props) { //effect hook useEffect(() => { const auth = getAuth(); //returns a function that will \"unregister\" (turn off) the listener const unregisterFunction = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (firebaseUser) => { //handle user state change if(firebaseUser){ //... } }) //cleanup function for when component is removed function cleanup() { unregisterFunction(); //call the unregister function } return cleanup; //effect hook callback returns the cleanup function }) } Firebase React Hooks In React systems it is common to render different content depending on whether the user is logged in. This could be done with conditional rendering, or with a “protected route” as described in Client-Side Routing. However, it takes a few seconds for Firebase to authenticate a user when a page first loads. Thus your conditional rendering will often need to handle 3 cases: when a user is logged in, when a user is not logged in, and when the user status is “loading” and the app hasn’t finished checking yet. While there are some cludgy workarounds (e.g., use a special value for your state to indicate that a user is “loading”), this is a common enough situation that you can use solutions implemented by other people. One such option is the firebase-react-hooks library. This library provides a simple hook (like useState or useParams) that lets you access the user status. In particular, the useAuthState hook will implement the authentication state listener for you: import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth'; import { useAuthState } from 'react-firebase-hooks/auth'; function MyComponent(props) { const auth = getAuth(); const [user, loading, error] = useAuthState(auth); if(loading){ //still waiting return &lt;p>Initializing user&lt;/p> } if(error) { //error logging in return &lt;p>Error: {error}&lt;/p> } if(user) { //user is defined, so logged in return &lt;p>Welcome {user.displayName}&lt;/p> } else { //user is undefined return &lt;p>Please sign in&lt;/p> } //... } This hook returns an array of 3 values (which are destructured in the above example), indicating the current user (or null for no user), whether the auth state is still loading, and whether there was an error. While using such a library is not necessary, it is a good example of how React’s architecture allows for external libraries that can help reduce boilerplate code. Resources Firebase Web Documentation Firebase Realtime Database Firebase Authentication "],["code-style-guide.html", "A Code Style Guide A.1 HTML Guidelines A.2 CSS Guidelines A.3 JavaScript Guidelines A.4 React Guidelines A.5 Miscellaneous Guidelines", " A Code Style Guide Computer code is read by two different audiences: computers, which execute the code statements (or render the web page), and humans who need to interpret and update the code over time. Using good coding style—the manner and format in which code is written—is vital for supporting the humans who read it. Poorly written code may be interpretable by the computer and thus work correctly, but it also needs to be understandale by people. Code that is well written (has “good style”) fulfills two properties: It is easy for people to read It is easy for people to modify in the future All coding style guidelines should follow from these two goals. If you ever wonder whether one styling approach is better than another, consider it in terms of those goals. Everyone has a differnet opinions on what is considered “good style”; indeed there are numerous existing “style guides” written for web programming languages: for example, Google has their own HTML/CSS and JavaScript style guides, as does Mozilla. There are also tools that enforce styling guidelines. “linters” such as ESLint will both identify syntactic errors, but also may have strong opinions on style, marking “poor style” as an error. I recommend being cautious with automatic code styling (“beautifier”) tools or plugins. While these can be useful, it’s also possible that they will “clean” your code in a way that doesn’t actually improve it. Be very careful with anything that writes or changes code for you to ensure that it’s doing the right thing! This chapter provides a number of specific guidelines following the opinions of the authors (and instructors of the INFO 340: Client Side Development course) in order to help you learn to write code that is generally easier to read and modify—that has good style. It is not intended to be comprehensive; rather it is a collection of guidelines that students often question or have troubles following intuitively. See the above linked style guides for more comprehensive suggestions. This chapter is a work in progress, with more guidelines being added as they come up. A.1 HTML Guidelines Always use lowercase letters for HTML tags. This helps with readability and consistency. &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;p>lorem ipsum&lt;/p> &lt;!-- Don't do this --> &lt;P>lorem ipsum&lt;/P> &lt;P>lorem ipsum&lt;/p> Spacing In general, put tags for block elements on their own lines, with the content of block elements as a separate (indented) line—unless the content of that block element is very short. Subsequent block eleents are indented an additional step. This makes it easier to read the code by seeing the blocks, as well as to modify the code by adding more content inside of blocks. &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;div> lorem ipsum &lt;/div> &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;div> &lt;p> lorem ipsum &lt;/p> &lt;/div> &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;p>Hello world&lt;/p> &lt;!-- short content so can be on same line as tags --> &lt;!-- Don't do this --> &lt;div>&lt;p>lorem ipsum&lt;/p>&lt;/div> For many inline elements—particularly text formatting ones (e.g., &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;a&gt;)—it’s best to keep them inline with the rest of the content. Think about like writing a paragraph, but some words in the middle are formatted. Don’t try to separate out the inline elements. This makes it easier to see them as “inline”, and means that you can integrate it into your code without needing to worry about spacing. (This will also often fix trailing space issues). Note that this guideline is one that automated beautifying tools mess up. &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;p> There was a farmer who had a dog, and &lt;em>Bingo&lt;/em> was his name-o... &lt;/p> &lt;!-- Don't do this --> &lt;p> There was a farmer who had a dog, and &lt;em>Bingo&lt;/em> was his name-o... &lt;/p> For “structural” inline elements (e.g., &lt;img&gt; , &lt;button&gt;), it’s better to put them on their own line similar to block elements. Indeed, these elements may often want to be styled as block elements anyway! &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;p> This is a picture of a dog: &lt;img src=\"puppy.png\" alt=\"a puppy\"> &lt;/p> &lt;!-- Don't do this --> &lt;p> This is a picture of a dog: &lt;img src=\"puppy.png\" alt=\"a puppy\"> &lt;/p> Element attributes should be written on the same line as the element tag they apply to—even if the attribute value seems “long” (like a URL). &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;a href=\"https://info340.github.io/really/long/path/to/content\">Link&lt;/a> &lt;!-- Don't do this --> &lt;a href=\"https://info340.github.io/really/long/path/to/content\">Link&lt;/a> Note that it is not valid HTML to put whitespace, including line breaks, around the = when defining an attribute. The one exception to this style guideline is when you have lots of attributes for a single element. In that situation, it’s acceptible to put each attribute on its own line, indented 1 step. While that rarely happens in straight HTML, it can be very common when specifying props for a React component (and makes it easier to modify those props as well). &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"user-input-field\" name=\"user-input-field\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Write something here!\" class=\"long-form-input\"> Write all text content of a single element as a single line of code; do not manually put line breaks inside of plain text. This will allow you to modify that text content later without needing to reformat things. Do not worry about the length of the line of code. You can use the “word wrap” functionality of your editor to avoid horizontal scrolling. &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;!-- This *single line of code* can be made to wrap in your editor --> &lt;p> Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Consectetur est necessitatibus, rerum atque officiis doloremque porro similique molestias fugit, a repellendus fuga natus, tempora impedit. Dolore repellendus itaque soluta est ad modi corrupti quibusdam tenetur architecto nesciunt harum ipsa consectetur ullam unde, quos sit asperiores corporis vitae pariatur expedita non? &lt;/p> &lt;!-- Don't do this --> &lt;p> Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Consectetur est necessitatibus, rerum atque officiis doloremque porro similique molestias fugit, a repellendus fuga natus, tempora impedit. Dolore repellendus itaque soluta est ad modi corrupti quibusdam tenetur architecto nesciunt harum ipsa consectetur ullam unde, quos sit asperiores corporis vitae pariatur expedita non? &lt;/p> Specific Elements Avoid non-semantic formatting elements (e.g., &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;), as they are not accessible to screen readers. Avoid using the &lt;br&gt; element for line breaks. If you’re breaking a line of text, it’s most often because you’re defining a new paragraph, and so should use an additional &lt;p&gt; element. If there isn’t a semantic meaning for the line break, don’t include one! If you need to adjust the amount of spacing between paragraphs (e.g., you want it to be a single spacing not double spacing), use CSS to adjust the margin or padding. &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;p> Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. &lt;/p> &lt;p> Consectetur est necessitatibus, rerum atque officiis doloremque porro similique molestias fugit, a repellendus fuga natus, tempora impedit. &lt;/p> &lt;!-- Don't do this --> &lt;p> Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. &lt;br /> Consectetur est necessitatibus, rerum atque officiis doloremque porro similique molestias fugit, a repellendus fuga natus, tempora impedit. &lt;p> The only reason I can think of for semanticaly using a &lt;br&gt; element would be in poetry: &lt;!-- Do this --> &lt;div> Roses are red, &lt;br> Violets are blue. &lt;br> Unexpected '}' &lt;br> on line 32. &lt;/div> Comments in HTML Most HTML content doesn’t need comments; it should be understandable just from the indentation and content. If your code needs more organization, use semantic elements (e.g., &lt;section&gt;) or class names to help structure it (e.g., &lt;div class=\"first-post\"&gt;). A.2 CSS Guidelines One piece of adviace for writing good CSS is to focus on the “minimal” amount of CSS needed to achieve your effect. Work with the browser and its defaults, rather than trying to overpower it. Perhaps surprisingly, removing rules or properties is usually a better fix to a problem then adding additional styling. A.2.1 Selectors Use selectors that are only as specific as they need to be. /* Do this */ li.selected {} /* selected list items, not selected paragraphs */ /* Don't do this */ div p {} /* paragraphs inside of divs (are there other paragraphs? */ /* Don't do this */ body p {} /* no paragraphs outside of the body, so redundant */ (It’s hard to show examples, because the required specificity depends on the situation!) Most selectors will involve 1-3 “pieces” (connected by descendant or compound selection). If you find yourself using more than that, ask if there’s a simpler way to write the selector—or just give the element a class to select it directly! Use class or element selectors instead of id selectors. /* Do this */ .side-nav {} /* Don't do this */ #side-nav {} If you must use an id selector, don’t add extra specificity before id selectors. An id has to be unique, so you don’t need to distinguish between multiple elements with the same id. /* Don't do this */ nav#side-nav {} Do not use the !important keyword. Write a sufficiently specific rule instead! /* Don't do this */ .error { color: red !important; } /* Do this */ p.alert.error { color: red; } A.2.2 Class Names Use descriptive class names. Classes should describe what or why that styling is being applied. /* Do this */ .side-nav {} /* Do this */ .alert-warning {} /* Don't do this */ .thingy {} /* Don't do this */ .s1 {} /* Don't do this */ .p {} /* use an element selector instead! */ Note that classes could either be defined semantically (e.g., .avatar-icon, .comment-form), or modularly (e.g., .font-large, .bg-secondary). Either approach is acceptable per this guide, but try to be consistent. Using naming schema such as BEM is also acceptable. Use hyphens as delimiters for class names. /* Do this */ .side-nav {} /* Do this */ .alert-warning {} Certain frameworks may make it sensible to use camelCasing for class naming (so class names are also valid JavaScript identifiers). In that case, be consistent with delimiters. This will make it easier to write and modify the code. /* Don't do this */ .sideNav {} .alert-warning {} A.2.3 Specific Properties Avoid using float; use flexboxes or grids for positioning. It is rare to actually have “floating” content (though it can happen with image inserts inside of large text-based articles). Avoid using position: absolute. This will produce layouts that are not responsive or accessible to multiple devices. Work with the browser’s layout instead by using relative layouts. A.2.4 Responsive CSS Use a mobile-first approach to styling. This means that general rules go at the top and apply to mobile devices, and then use media queries to specify style alterations for larger displays. Media queries check against minimize size only: /* Do this */ @media (min-width: 768px) {} /* Do not do this */ @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1092px) {} /* Do not do this */ @media (max-width: 768px) {} Limiting styling rules to screen is not required (unless you distinctly want those to be different from printed rules) /* Do this */ @media (min-width: 768px) {} /* Do not need to do this */ @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {} Media queries should be used to modify the mobile device styling, not to replace it completely. Don’t “reset” all of the rules from the mobile styling, just override and add-to the few rules needed to make the page effectively responsive. Your page should have a similar style/theme no matter what device is being used to view the content! A.2.5 Comments in CSS You do not need a lot of comments for CSS code; your rules should be self-explanatory because you’ve used descriptive class names. Use comments to help organize or “sign-post” your code, to group rules together in your .css file. /* Do this */ /* navbar */ nav {} nav li {} .tab-selected {} /* main content */ section {} p {} img.small {} A.3 JavaScript Guidelines A.3.1 Variables Declare variables using const or let. In general, use const for all variables, and then let only if you find you need to reassign the variable later (which is a lot less common then you may think)! Do not use var to declare variables (this avoid polluting the global scope). Variable names are written in camelCaseFormat (capitalizing the first letter of each “word” in the name after the first). Do not begin variable names with a capital letter. /* Do this */ const myName = \"Joel Ross\" /* Do not do this */ const my_name = \"Joel Ross\" /* Do not do this */ const MyName = \"Joel Ross\" You can use all capital letters for global constants. Note that just because a variable is declared const doesn’t mean it is a “global constant”. Use all capital letters to name values that are specified external to the functioning of your program; PI, WA_TAX_RATE, SCREEN_WIDTH are all global constants. Use descriptive variable names. Variable names should what the value references. Do not use names like stuff, thing, or x as they won’t help anyone understand your code. Name arrays and collections using plural nouns. Alternatively, you may find it useful to name strings, arrays, objects, and functions after their data type to help you remember (particularly if understanding plurals in English is difficult). /* Do this */ const names = [\"john\", \"paul\", \"george\", \"ringo\"]; /* Do this */ const dogArray = [\"fido\", \"spot\", \"rover\"]; //array of dog names const dogObj = {name: 'Fido', breed: 'mutt'}; //single dog object /* Do not do this */ const dog = [\"fido\", \"spot\", \"rover\"]; //an array named by a singular noun A.3.2 Functions Use function declarations rather than function expressions when defining functions—particularly “top-level” functions. This helps distinguish between functions and variables, making it easier to read and follow the code (even if it takes more typing). /* Do this */ function sum(a, b) { return a + b; } /* Do not do this */ const sum = function(a, b) { return a + b; } /* Do not do this */ const sum = (a, b) => a + b; For inline functions (such as anonymous callback functions), use arrow notation. This can keep things more concise and also avoid some scoping problems. /* Do this */ const transformed = array.map((item) => { //... }) /* Do not do this */ const transformed = array.map(function(item) { //... }) When using arrow functions, always put the () around the argument list. This clarifies that it is a function and will make things easier if/when you want to add additional arguments. /* Do this */ const transformed = array.map((item) => { //... }) /* Do not do this */ const transformed = array.map(item => { //... }) In general, avoid using concise body arrow functions. Including the explicit block (the {}) makes it easier to read as a function, as well as to modify and debug since you can add additional statements easily. It may seem like more code to type, but it’s better style. /* Do this */ const exclaimed = stringArray.map((aString) => { return aString + \"!!\" //add exclamation points }) /* Do not do this */ const exclaimed = stringArray.map((aString) => aString + \"!!\") Functions should be defined to be short and reusable. Using pure functions whenever possible. This means that they avoid side effects—they do not assign to or modify non-local variables. A.3.3 Comments in JavaScript “Comments are always failures.” - Robert Martin In general well-written code documents itself without the need for additional comments. Functions that are well named with small scopes will clearly indicate what they do without the need for further notation. If you find that you need a comment to explain what your code does, then you probably should rewrite that code so that it’s more readable. Comments should be used to provide further information about the intent of code (why it has been included), not the behavior of code (what it does). This means that in general you shouldn’t need to include a lot of comments in your code. Use comments as a last resort to clarify code behavior or otherwise communicate with other people. Do not retain large blocks of commented code in production (final) versions—be clear about the code you’re using without requiring the user to scroll past or ignore a lot of code that you’re not. A.3.4 Miscellaneous JavaScript Guidelines Use strict equality comparisons (=== and !==) instead of regular equality comparisons (== and !=). Minimize the use of console.log() statements in production (final) versions. These will slow your program down, pollute the logging space, and can be a source of information and security leaks. Use lots of console.log() statements when debugging, but remove them when you’ve fixed the bugs. A.4 React Guidelines A.4.1 Components Use Component functions (and hooks). Do not define components as classes. Use function declarations rather than function expressions when defining Component functions. This helps with readability. /* Do this */ function Card(props) { //... } /* Do not do this */ const Card = (props) => { //... } Component functions are named using nouns (what they are), not verbs (what they do). You name then like you would name classes in Java or other OOP languages. /* Do this - what the content is */ function EntryForm(props) //... } /* Do not do this - what it does */ function UpdateData(props) { //... } Give Components descripive names that indicate what “kind” of element they are, so there is no confusion about whether they are nouns or verbs. /* Do this - the component is a form */ function FilterForm(props) //... } /* Do not do this - unclear what the component is */ function Filter(props) { //... } The argument to a Component is always called props (with an s at the end!). It is acceptable to use object destructuring in the argument to a Component function. Remember to include the {}—a Component only accepts a single argument! /* Acceptable */ function SongCard(props) //... } /* Also acceptable */ function SongCard({artist, title, album}) { //... } Organize Components into separate modules (.js files). You can include multiple related components (e.g,. a Card and a CardList) in the same module. It’s a good idea to keep these files together inside of a distinct components folder in your source code. A.4.2 Mapping Data Do not declare functions such as the .map() callback inline inside the return statement of a Component (or any other function). Use multiple statements when writing code! Instead, declare the mapped values as a separate variable that can be included inside of the returned DOM. This will make your code easier to read, modify, and debug since you can add additional processing or inspections after the .map() call. /* Do this */ function App(props) { //map the data into &lt;Card> elements const cardElemArray = data.map((dataItem) => { return &lt;Card value={dataItem} key={dataItem.id} /> }) return ( &lt;div> {cardElemArray} &lt;/div> ) } /* Do not do this */ function App(props) { //This is all one statement (line) of code! Don't do that. return ( &lt;div> { data.map((dataItem) => { return &lt;Card value={dataItem} key={dataItem.id} /> }) } &lt;/div> ) } A.4.3 State Always use const when declaring state variables (since you don’t reassign them anyway)! /* Do this */ const [data, setData] = useState([]); /* Do not do this */ let [data, setData] = useState([]); Always name the “state setter” function after the name of the state variable (set______): /* Do this */ const [data, setData] = useState([]); const [currentsong, setCurrentSong] = useState({}); /* Do not do this */ const [nowPlaying, changeSong] = useState({}); const [lastTrack, setLast] = useState({}); //use the full variable name instead! Do not duplicate data in state. It’s both bad style and will cause bugs. Keep state minimal. Do not define state variables for values that can be computed from other variables. /* Do this */ const [myArray, setMyArray] = useState([]); const arrayLength = myArray.length; //computed from state, but not a state variable /* Do not do this */ const [myArray, setMyArray] = useState([]); const [arrayLength, setArrayLength] = useState(0); //duplicated data Do not have multiple components save the same data in their state. Instead, lift the state up to the appropriate level and pass the data down as a prop. /* Do this */ function App(props) { const [data, setData] = useState([]); return ( {/* pass down the data as a prop */} &lt;CardList data={data} /> ) } /* Do not do this */ function App(props) { const [data, setData] = useState([]); return ( &lt;CardList data={data} /> ) } function CardList(props) { const [data, setData] = useState(props.data); //... } Do not pass state setter functions as callbacks to child components. Instead, create a separate callback function which can call the state setter. This makes it easier to add additional processing and control logic when updating state, as well as following the Principle of Least Knowledge /* Do this */ function App(props) { const [data, setData] = useState([]); //a function to update the data const updateData = (newData) => { //can do additional processing here setData(newData); //update the state } return ( {/* pass down the callback function as a prop */} &lt;UpdateForm data={data} updateCallback={updateData} /> ) } /* Do not do this */ function App(props) { const [data, setData] = useState([]); return ( {/* Do not pass the state setter directly! */} &lt;UpdateForm data={data} updateCallback={setData} /> ) } A.4.4 Events and Forms All forms should be controlled, managing the inputted value through the Component’s state (instead of the HTML element’s state). This helps avoid data duplication, following the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle. /* Do this */ function ExampleForm(props) { const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('') const handleChange = (event) => { let newValue = event.target.value setInputValue(newValue); } return ( &lt;input type=\"text\" onChange={handleChange} value={inputValue} /> ) } A.5 Miscellaneous Guidelines Name all files and folder (source code or otherwise) with all lowercase letters. This will keep things consistent and avoid bugs across operating systems. Do not include spaces () in file names, particular for media assets—do not have a file named my puppy.png. Instead replace the space with an alternate character, such as an _, a -, or a +. Whitespace characters need to be specially encoded for URIs, which can cause problems and readability issues. "],["jest.html", "B Testing with Jest B.1 Testing B.2 Testing with Jest B.3 Writing a Test B.4 Testing Web Apps with Jest", " B Testing with Jest People just aren’t as repeatable as computers are. Nor should we expect them to be. A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time. It can be put under source control, so you can examine changes to the procedure over time as well (“but it used to work…”). - The Pragmatic Programmer This chapter introduces automated testing using the Jest framework. By following this tutorial, you will learn how to write and execute simple unit tests on JavaScript functions and DOM manipulating code. This tutorial references code found at https://github.com/info343/jest-tutorial. B.1 Testing One of the most important goals when developing computer programs is to make sure that the code you write actually works. You can determine if a program works by considering three things: What input was given to the program? From a user perspective, this is what actions that user took (e.g., “I pressed a button”). From a code perspective, this is often what value was passed to a method. Running the program with a particular input will lead to a received result: something will happen because of the input. From a user perspective, this would be this would be like the changes to a web page caused by the button press. From a code perspective, this could be the value returned by that function (or potentially a new value for a state variable). To know if a program worked though, you need to know the expected result of that program: what was supposed to happen because of the input? If you don’t know what the program was supposed to do, then you’ll have no way of knowing if it worked or not! You can test a program by providing the input and then comparing the received result. If the received result matches the expected result, then you know that the program worked! Testing is simply the process of providing the inputs and comparing the received and expected results Providing the input and then comparing the received and expected results can get tedious, particularly if you have lots of possible inputs or they require multiple steps (like clicking on multiple buttons). For that reason, it’s helpful to use automation to let a computer perform the testing for you. You define the expected result of some action, and the computer will check if the received result matches. Because automated testing is so useful and comment, there are a wide variety of testing frameworks: external scripts that provide the code to let you easily compare received and expected results. In JavaScript, the most popular testing frameworks are Jasmine, Mocha (which is just the framework, it uses Chai to actually compare received and expected results—hot beverages are a theme), and Jest. The later was developed by Facebook specifically to support testing React applications, and is the framework introduced and used in this course (though its API is almost identical to Jasmine and Mocha/Chai). B.2 Testing with Jest Jest is a command line program so you will need to have it installed on your machine. It can be installed globally through npm: npm install -g jest Additionally, you will need to install the dependencies listed in this repository’s package.json file, which will allow tests to use ES6 module syntax to access the functions in a separate file to test (as well as auto-complete definitions for Jest!) # install all dependencies npm install With Jest, you define “tests”, which are just JavaScript code that is used to perform the action and compare the received and expected results. These tests can either be placed in a file whose name ends with .test.js (indicating it is a test script), .spec.js (for “specification”), or a plain .js file inside the __tests__ folder in your program. In either case, a test script is just a JavaScript file, so you include any JavaScript code/variables/functions/etc. you want. B.3 Writing a Test We define a “test” (a check if a particular piece of functionality works) by calling the test() function—a predefined function provided by the Jest framework. This functions take two arguments: a string describing what the test is checking, and a callback function that will contain the code to run which does the action and compares the results. test('should do something...', function() { //regular old Javascript code that will perform the test goes here }); Test descriptions (the string parameter) are written in present tense, and state in plain English what behavior SHOULD happen. Starting the description with the word “should” is a good approach! Jest also provides a function it() that is an alias for test(), and lets the code read like badly punctuated English: it('should do something', function() { ... }); Assertions and Matchers We check that the program actually does what we’re testing by writing an assertion. An assertion is a proposition that some fact is true. In this case, we are going to assert that the expected result and the actual result are the same. If that proposition is shown to be valid (our claim that the results matched is true), then we know that our claim that the program works must hold and thus we “pass” the test! You can think of an assertion as a bit like doing the work of an if-else statement: if(received value == expected value){ test passes } else { test fails } In Jest, we put forth an assertion by calling the expect() function with an appropriate matcher. The expect() function takes a single parameter, which is the received result (produced by doing the action; e.g., calling the function with a particular input). A matcher is another function that is called directly on the returned value of expect(), and takes as an argument the expected result that we want to compare. The matcher does the work of actually comparing the values, and then reporting the validity of our claim back to Jest: test('should add numbers correctly', function() { expect(1+1).toEqual(2); }); In this case, .toEqual() is the “matcher” which compare the received and expected values to see if they are equal. Be careful about your parentheses! The expect() function should take a single expression (even if that expression includes a function call), and the matcher is called after the expect() function. Using local variables can help with readability. Jest supports a wide variety of matchers. For example: //can do numerical comparison expect(receivedNumber).toBeGreaterThan(expectedNumber); //compare against undefined expect(receivedValue).toBeDefined(); //check if defined! //find receivedValue in an array expect(receivedArray).toContain(expectedValue); //can negate ANY matcher with a .not property expect(receivedValue).not.toEqual(expectedValue); See the documentation for a complete list. Note that a single test() can include multiple assertions! Organizing Tests You can “group” tests together by using the describe() function. This function takes two parameters: a string that describes what feature is being tested, and a callback function that contains the code for the tests: describe('Basic math', function() { it('should add numbers correctly', function() { expect(1+1).toEqual(2); }); }); You should name your feature and test features so that they read as: {Feature name} should {do something specific} This will allow the test results to be communicated very clearly, even to non-developers (e.g., to your boss or client). describe() blocks can contain multiple tests(), and even other describe() blocks if you want to separate subfeatures. It is also possible to run particular blocks of code before groups of tests are run by using the beforeEach() and beforeAll() functions. See Setup and Teardown for details. Running the Tests You can run the test (have the computer perform the testing work) by using the jest command line program, passing it the name of the text script (without the extension) that you wish to run: # test the app.spec.js file jest app The command line will print out the results of this test script: An example passing script This will tell you what tests were run, which “passed” (were green for good to go!) and which “failed” (were red). Failed tests will also report which assertion failed, and what the expected and received values were that didn’t match. Practice This repo’s app.js file contains a function invertCase(). In the provides app.spec.js file, implement a describe() block to contains tests for the function, and write unit tests to check it for bugs (by giving it specific inputs and checking the received vs. the expected result). If you find any bugs, fix them and then re-run your tests! B.4 Testing Web Apps with Jest It is also possible to use Jest to JavaScript code that is used to manipulate the DOM. You can do this because Jest creates a virtual DOM that you can interact with. That is, jest provides a global document object that you can access and call methods on (e.g., document.querySelector()). This isn’t a full browser: it won’t load external CSS files or allow you to navigate to pages, but it does provide a tree of HTML elements you can modify and inspect. allowing you to test your DOM manipulation. There are a few steps to being able to work effectively with the document provided by Jest: First, you will want to make sure the content of the DOM includes the HTML elements you wish to test with. This is called mounting the content. You can mount some HTML content by assigning it to the innerHTML of the DOM’s root element—not the &lt;html&gt; element, but a virtual element that acts as the ultimate parent of the DOM (similar to the root / folder on an operating system). This node can be accessed via the document.documentElement property: //assign a given HTML content (e.g., as string) to the virtual DOM document.documentElement.innerHTML = \"&lt;html>&lt;head>&lt;/head>&lt;body>...&lt;/body>&lt;/html>\"; Often, this HTML content is read directly from the file, using Node’s fs (file system) library. Because the document object only represents the DOM tree (the rendered HTML), it won’t apply any embedded &lt;script&gt; tags. So in order to run your script on the DOM and modify it, you will need to manually apply those scripts. But since Jest has already defined you a document object to modify, you can simply tell Jest to load and run your script! Your code will do the exact same thing it does in the browser, just querying and modifying Jest’s virtual DOM (document) rather than the browser’s DOM. You load an external script in Jest by using Node’s require() function, passing it the relative path to the script file you wish to load (this script must be saved locally): //load the `index.js` file require('../js/index.js'); Note that this path is relative to the location of the test script, not relative to the location of the .html file (since Jest doesn’t use the HTML). If the script file is in the same directory as the spec file, you will need to put a ./ in front of the filename path to indicate that you’re giving a path rather than naming a module. You will need to also explicitly have Jest load any external libraries (such as jQuery) you wish to use. These libraries will need to be loaded from a local file (Jest can’t access a CDN), but they can usually be installed via npm. For example, you would load jQuery with: $ = require('jquery'); //load the jQuery module (installed from npm) window.$ = $; //assign make the jQuery library into a DOM global Remember to load any external scripts before your own! Finally, you can use DOM methods (or jQuery helpers!) to trigger events (like button clicks). You can then inspect the DOM with document.querySelector() and run assertions about the state of DOM after that user action. //for example let h1 = document.querySelector('h1'); expert(h1.textContent).toEqual('Hello world!'); And with that, you can automatically test if your page’s interactivity works as expected without needing to repeatedly click on a button. In particular, these automatic tests can help you make sure that future changes don’t break your code (e.g., don’t cause the tests to fail), performing what is called regression testing. You should still test your page inside the browser, just to catch any platform differences between Jest’s virtual DOM and actual web browsers. Practice Write a test in the provided index.spec.js file to confirm that when the “Panic” button is pressed, the HTML’s .alert element is displayed. "],["webpack.html", "C Lab: Webpack C.1 What is Webpack? C.2 Getting Started C.3 webpack.config.js C.4 Loaders", " C Lab: Webpack This lab is intended to walk you through the basics of the Webpack module bundling system. Webpack is the tool most commonly used in the React &amp; Javascript community to transpile and bundle components, and is what is used under the hood by create-react-app (we’ll be using this next week!). While that scaffolding tool means you don’t need to know how to set up Webpack, it is good to be at least somewhat familiar with the concept (and this exercise will give you further practice working with npm modules). This tutorial is adapted from one by Tyler McGinnis. C.1 What is Webpack? Webpack is a build tool. That is, it is a (command line) application that is used to automatically take the source code you write and prepare that code to be run/executed, whether for development or deployment. There are numerous such build tools in existence: Gulp is the major competitor to Webpack, and most IDEs (like jGrasp or IntelliJ) provide them. However, Webpack is favored by React developers because of how easily and speedily it transpiles JSX. At its core, Webpack is a module loader: it takes source files like JavaScript modules and bundles them into a few simplified files that can be part of your webpage. It takes your complicated source code structure (lots of files) and transforms it into a brand-new, “simplified” version (few files). C.2 Getting Started There are two things you need to do to get started: First, we need to create the package.json file to store information about the app you’re building, including dependencies that Webpack will use. You can do this with the following command: cd path/to/project npm init You will be prompted for a bunch of information to provide about your app. Give it the following details (just hit &lt;enter&gt; to accept the details on any other prompts) name should be “webpack-tutorial” author should be your name Once you’re finished, you will be asked to confirm your choices (type yes), and you’ll have a brand new package.json file ready to use! :bulb: If you just want a blank package.json file, use npm init -y to skip the prompts! Locally install the webpack program. This will allow you to run the program from the command line and bundle your app. Using the --save-dev flag saves the module to your devDependencies, which will not be bundled in the bundled version of your app. npm install --save-dev webpack C.3 webpack.config.js While Webpack can be used to do simple bundling from the command line (see the official tutorial for an example), it’s most common to write down all of your bundling options inside a configuration file. This file is basically just a JavaScript file that defines a variable that represents all of the different options you’d want to pass to the webpack program. If you name this file webpack.config.js, Webpack will read in that configuration automatically. Thus “using Webpack” really involves creating this file. Create a new file called webpack.config.js and open it up in your favorite editor (e.g., VS Code). Inside this file, add the following line of code: module.exports = {} This is the CommonJS version of the ES6 export default {}—you are defining an object (initially empty) that will be exported and used by the Webpack program. The rest of this tutorial will involve adding properties to this object. Note that is it possible to use ES 6 style import and export commands, but you need to name your file webpack.config.babel.js and will need to have some Babel libraries installed. See here for discussion. For this lab, stick to the CommonJS syntax. Webpack’s basic job is to take your source files, changing them in some way, and producing a new version. Thus there are three things you’ll need to specify: What files to transform (specifically: what JavaScript file makes your program start) What transformations to make Where to save the transformed files entry and output We specify the first piece (what files to transform) by giving the exported object an entry property: module.exports = { //list of entry points entry: [ __dirname + '/src/index.js' ] } This indicates which file (relative to the folder you are currently in) is the “start” or “entry point” into your program—in a way, which file has “main” in it. In our case, src/index.js (the __dirname is a Node constant referring to the current working directory). Note that the entry property is actually an array, since it’s possible to support multiple entry points. We’ll skip step 2 for a moment and also specify where to save the transformed files. This is specified as the output property of the config object: module.exports = { entry: [ __dirname + '/src/index.js' ], output: { filename: \"bundle.js\", path: __dirname + '/dist' }, } The output property is itself an object with more details about the output (rather than an array of possible outputs). The above example says that we should output into the dist folder (in the current directory), combining the code into a file called bundle.js. Since we don’t have webpack installed globally (which you’re welcome to do if you wish npm install -g webpack), we’ll need to add to our package.json file, to tell npm what to do with our local files! Adding to your package.json file, we’ll need to update the scripts key: ... \"scripts\": { \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\", \"build\": \"webpack\" }, ... Now, if you run npm run build, the project will build! Similar to npm install, when we run this command, we tell npm that, within this project, we want to run the build script, which will call the local version of webpack to run. When webpack runs, it looks for the webpack.config.js file, and then executes using that file to build your project! Here is roughly the output you should see: &gt; webpack-demo@1.0.0 build /Users/joelross/Desktop/webpack-demo &gt; webpack Hash: fc5c075a9cfa7ee938c0 Version: webpack 3.8.1 Time: 56ms Asset Size Chunks Chunk Names bundle.js 3 kB 0 [emitted] main [0] multi ./src/index.js 28 bytes {0} [built] [1] ./src/index.js 390 bytes {0} [built] This will create a new file dist/bundle.js. If you view this file in VS Code, you’ll see it contains some extra code that organizes the different modules into functions (to support variable scoping), one of which is the content of the index.js file! C.4 Loaders Look at all this red! This is the support that ES6 has among today’s modern browsers. What does this mean? While ES6 features are being adopted more and more, there isn’t great uniform support for it. So, we have to do a little trick called transpiling our code so that all browsers know what our Javascript is doing. To do this, we use what are called loaders. A loader is basically a plugin that is used to perform a particular transformation (e.g., transpiling JSX or even ES 6 syntax!). Webpack’s strength is its set of loaders that enable it to handle pretty much any kind of file and transformation. (It’s of course possible to write your own, but that’s well beyond the scope of this tutorial). The module property is used to specify the list of loaders: module.exports = { entry: [ __dirname + '/src/index.js' ], output: { filename: \"bundle.js\", path: __dirname + '/dist' }, module: { loaders: [ { test: /\\.jsx?$/, loaders: [\"babel-loader\"], } ] }, } The module property is an object that itself contains a loaders property, which is an array of loaders to apply. Each loader is described as an object (see? The nesting really does occur!). The test property indicates which file types we want the loader to transform. This may look scary and confusion, but that’s because it’s using a Regular Expression (similar to how you split words in the JavaScript Challenge) to specify the file extension that we want to consider. This particular expression indicates files that end in .js or .jsx (the later is often used for JSX React components). How to make sense of this expression and its crazy punctuation: Regular expressions are like Strings, but surrounded by / / instead of \" \" The . in .js needs to be escaped, so has a \\ in front of it. Like \\n for newlines. The x in .jsx is op tional (without it we have .js, which is fine), so is written with a ? after it to indicate that it can be present or not. The last $ indicates the “end of the line”, so means we’ll only talk about files that end in .js (e.g., libray.js.css wouldn’t get transformed). the loaders property is a list of which loaders we want to apply to files whose names match the “test”. In our case, we use Babel to transform our JSX, so we’ll be using \"babel\" as our loader. Babel Loader Loaders such as Babel need to be installed individually using npm as if they were separate programs (since they are in fact separate libraries!). This we will need to install the babel-loader package to be able to apply Babel transformations: npm install babel-loader --save-dev (The --save-dev argument here is like --save in that it saves the dependency into your package.json file. However, --save-dev lists the dependency as only needed for development, not for deployment. Thus if you wanted to upload your code to a web server (like on AWS), this would let that server know that it doesn’t need to install Babel because you’ve already transpiled the code into a production build). But because nothing is ever simple, the babel-loader actually requires an additional library (babel-core, which is the Babel program itself) to do its work. Thus we also need to install: npm install babel-core --save-dev Babel is able to perform all kinds of transformations, such as compiling JSX and converting ES6 syntax into older, browser-compatible versions. Babel is very modular, so each transformation we want to apply can be downloaded as an individual libraries called presets. npm install babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev This installs babel-preset-es2015 (the transformation for ES 6). Of course, downloading to preset transformations doesn’t automatically tell Babel to use them. To do that, we actually need to create another file that will contain which presets Babel should use. This file is called .babelrc (“rc” stands for “run commands”; note the leading . indicating a hidden file). Create this file in the same directory as webpack.config.js. Your .babelrc file just contains some JSON indicating which presets to use (other options are possible as well): { \"presets\": [\"es2015\"] } Altogether, you’ve specified what Babel transformations to apply (in .babelrc), and told your Webpack config file to use Babel to modify any JavaScript files. So finally, you should be able to use webpack to build a working version of your React program next week! Open the index.html file in a Browser to see your lovely app. Some things to note: All your code is inside the bundle.js file. Whenever you change your code, you will need to “re-build” your application (run webpack again). There are further webpack plugins that can help automate this, such as ones that will automatically refresh the page when the source files change. Clean up :bath: Now that we’ve put in the hard work making webpack bundle our files, let’s actually convert our files to proper ES6 synxtax and use correct import statements, given that only Chrome supports importing natively with special exceptions. Be sure to export the functions from src/sorter.js, src/looper.js and src/printer.js! Now that they’re exported, use ES6 syntax in src/index.js to import the functions &gt; Hint: 3rd syntax in the list here Delete the index.html &lt;script&gt; tags for your files. One last thing: in src/sorter.js, we’re using an npm package called lodash to sort the array. Run npm install --save lodash (--save because we want the module to be used in our final app) and then import lodash in the src/sorter.js file. Hint: use the second import syntax from the MDN docs With any luck, running npm run build one last time should give you a good output, and finally, opening index.html and looking at the console log should have your sorted user array! Further Loader Practice The webpage doesn’t look great yet, because there is no styling (CSS) involved. To practice working with webpack loaders, add an import for main.css stylesheet to your index.js, and modify webpack.config.js so that it will bundle that file: Add the import to your index.js file. The file path should be relative to the index.js file. Install the style-loader and css-loader webpack loaders (remember to --save-dev). Together, these loaders are able to handle CSS files. Add another element to the module.loaders array in the webpack.config.js file to specify the style-loader transformation. The test should be a regular expression for files ending in .css The loader itself should be \"style-loader!css-loader\", which refers to the “css loader” module for the style-loader plugin. Re-build your application using webpack. If you reload the page, you should now see it has a gray background! There are lots of further configurations and options used by Webpack. For example, you can use the webpack-dev-server to have webpack run a local server that will automatically re-bundle modules when the files change. You are encouraged to check out that example if you have time. Lab written in part by Evan Frawley "],["class-components.html", "D React Class Components D.1 Props in Class Components D.2 Handling Events in Class Components D.3 State in Class Components D.4 The Component Lifecycle Resources", " D React Class Components As mentioned in Introduction to React, it’s also possible to define React Components using ES 6 class syntax: //Define a class component representing information about a user class UserInfo extends React.Component { //Components MUST override the `render()` function, which must return a //DOM element render() { //This is an everyday function; you can include any code you want here let name = \"Ethel\"; let descriptor = \"Aardvark\"; //Return a React element (JSX) that is how the component will appear return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>{name}&lt;/h1> &lt;p>Hello, my name is {name} and I am a {descriptor}&lt;/p> &lt;/div> ) } } This chapter contains further details on working with this style of Class Components, in particular how to manage manage state within such components. This chapter can thus be read as a mirror of [Interactive React], just using class components instead of function components. This chapter is taken from an earlier version of the text that emphasized class components instead of function components. D.1 Props in Class Components When defining a Class component, all of the passed in props are automatically assigned to the props instance variable, accessible as this.props. The this.props variable contains the object that would be passed as an argument to a function version of the component. //Define a component representing information about a user class UserInfo extends Component { render() { //access the individual props from inside the `this.props` object let userName = this.props.userName; let descriptor = this.props.descriptor; return ( &lt;div> &lt;h1>{userName}&lt;/h1> &lt;p>Hello, my name is {name} and I am a {descriptor}&lt;/p> &lt;/div> ) } } let userInfo = &lt;UserInfo userName=\"Ethel\" descriptor=\"Aardvark\" />; Note that the this.props object is read only—meaning that you cannot assign new values to it, nor modify its props directly. You should just think of props as immutable data that is coming in from outside of the component (again, similar to function arguments). A component doesn’t create or change is own props, it just uses those to determine how to render its content. D.2 Handling Events in Class Components When using class components, events are handled in the same way as with function components (e.g., using the onClick prop). The main difference is that event handler callbacks are usually defined as separate methods of the class: //A component representing a button that logs a message when clicked class MyButton extends Component { //method to call when clicked. The name is conventional, but arbitrary //the callback function will be passed the DOM event handleClick(event) { console.log('clicky clicky'); } render() { //make a button with an `onClick` attribute! //this \"registers\" the listener and sets the callback return &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!&lt;/button>; } } Note that when assigning the method to the onClick prop, the method is referenced using the this keyword (and no parentheses!), because the reference is to this Component’s handleClick() method. Accessing this Component from Events It is very common to have a Component’s event callback functions need to reference the instance variables or methods of that component—such as to do something based with a prop (found in this.props) or to call an additional helper method (called as this.otherMethod()). In short—the event callback will need to have access to the this context. But as discussed in Section 15.2, callback functions are not called on any particular object, and thus do not have a value assigned to their this variable. In the example above, although you’re using the word this to refer to the method this.handleClick (to tell JavaScript where to find the function), that function is not actually being called on the class. As described in Section 15.2, just because the method was defined inside a class doesn’t mean it needs to be called on an instance of that class! //BUGGY CODE: A button that causes and error when clicked! class MyButton extends Component { handleClick(event) { //Reference the object's `this.props` instance variable. But since `this` //is undefined when executed as a callback, it will cause a //TypeError: Cannot read property 'props' of undefined console.log(\"You clicked on\", this.props.text) } render() { //Specifies function (which happens to be a class method) as a callback return &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.props.text}&lt;/button>; } } //Render the component, passing it a prop ReactDOM.render(&lt;MyButton text=\"Click me!\"/>, document.getElementById('root')); As such, you will need to make sure to “retain” the this context when specifying an event callback function. There are a few ways to do this. First, as described in Chapter 15, an arrow function will utilize the same lexical this as the context it is defined in. Thus you can “wrap” the event callback function in an arrow function in order to keep the this, calling that method on the this instance explicitly: class MyButton extends Component { handleClick(event) { console.log(\"You clicked on\", this.props.text) //functions as expected! } render() { return ( &lt;button onClick={(evt) => this.handleClick(evt) }> {this.props.text} &lt;/button> ) } } In this example, the onClick listener is passed an anonymous callback function (in the form of an arrow function), which does the work of calling the handleClick() method on the instance (this). In effect, you’re defining a “temporary” recipe to register with the event listener, whose one instruction is “follow this other recipe”. Notice that this approach also has the bonus feature of enabling you to pass additional arguments to the event callback! React does note that this approach can have a performance penalty—you are creating a new function (the arrow function) every time the component gets rendered, and components may be rendered a lot as you make React apps interactive! This won’t be noticeable as you are just getting started, but can begin to make a difference for large-scale applications. An alternative approach is to use a public class field to define the method. This is an experimental JavaScript syntax—it is currently being considered for official inclusion in the JavaScript language. However, the Babel transpiler supports this syntax (transforming it into a bound class function), and that support is enabled in Create React App allowing you to use the syntax for React apps. A public class field is a field (instance variable) that is assigned at value the “top level” of a class, rather than explicitly assigning to a property of this in the constructor. //A class with a public class field class Counter { x = 0; //assign the value here, not in the constructor increment() { this.x = this.x + 1; //can access the field as usual } } let counter = new Counter(); counter.increment(); console.log(counter.x); //outputs 1 But since you can assign any type of value to a field—including functions—you can use a public class field and define the event callback, using an arrow function to maintain the bound this context: class MyButton extends Component { //define event callback as a public class field (using an arrow function) handleClick = (event) => { console.log(\"You clicked on\", this.props.text) //functions as expected! } render() { return &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.props.text}&lt;/button>; } } Although somewhat more tricky to read and interpret (particularly if the callback takes no parameters), this approach allows you to specify a bound function (which will have the correct value for this), while still being able to reference the function directly when registering the event listener—without having to wrap it in a separate arrow function. At the time of writing, this approach is the “cool” way that callback functions are specified in React. D.3 State in Class Components React Components store their state in the state instance variable (accessed as this.state). Unlike props that are specified as inputs to the Component, the state must be initially assigned a value, which should be done in the Component’s constructor: //A button that tracks how many times it was clicked class CountingButton extends Component { constructor(props) { //the constructor must take a `props` parameter super(props) //the constructor must call superclass constructor //initialize the Component's state this.state = { count: 0 //a value contained in the state } } render() { //can _access_ values from the state in the `render()` function return &lt;button>You clicked me {this.state.count} times&lt;/button>; } } Because Components inherit (extend) the React.Component class, their constructors must do the same work as the parent class (so that they can function in the same way). In particular, the constructor must take in a single parameter (representing the props that are passed into the Component). It must then immediately call the parent’s version of the constructor (and pass in those props) using super(props). This will cause the props to be setup correctly, so that you can use them as normal. Inside the constructor, you initialize the this.state value (and this is usually all you do in the constructor!). The this.state value must be a JavaScript Object which can store specific data—you can’t make the state a String or a Number, but an object that can contain Strings and/or Numbers (with keys to label them). You can access the values currently stored in the state through the this.state instance variable. You will usually do this in the render() (or in a helper method called by the render() function). If a value doesn’t get used for rendering, it probably doesn’t need to be part of the state! React Components must store their state in the state instance variable (accessed as this.state). Unlike props that are specified as inputs to the Component, the state must be initially assigned a value, which should be done in the Component’s constructor: //A button that tracks how many times it was clicked class CountingButton extends Component { constructor(props) { //the constructor must take a `props` parameter super(props) //the constructor must call superclass constructor //initialize the Component's state this.state = { count: 0 //a value contained in the state } } render() { //can _access_ values from the state in the `render()` function return &lt;button>You clicked me {this.state.count} times&lt;/button>; } } Because Components inherit (extend) the React.Component class, their constructors must do the same work as the parent class (so that they can function in the same way). In particular, the constructor must take in a single parameter (representing the props that are passed into the Component). It must then immediately call the parent’s version of the constructor (and pass in those props) using super(props). This will cause the props to be setup correctly, so that you can use them as normal. Inside the constructor, you initialize the this.state value (and this is usually all you do in the constructor!). The this.state value must be a JavaScript Object which can store specific data—you can’t make the state a String or a Number, but an object that can contain Strings and/or Numbers (with keys to label them). You can access the values currently stored in the state through the this.state instance variable. You will usually do this in the render() (or in a helper method called by the render() function). If a value doesn’t get used for rendering, it probably doesn’t need to be part of the state! Changing the State Data is stored in the state so that can be changed over time. You can modify a Component’s state by calling the setState() method on that Component. This method usually takes as a parameter an object that contains the new desired values for the state; this set of new values will be “merged” into the existing state, changing only the indicated values (other values will be left alone): //An element that displays the time when asked class Clock extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { currentTime: new Date(), //current time alarmSound: \"annoying_buzz.mp3\" //changeable alarm sound } } //callback function for the button (public class field) handleClick = (props) => { let stateChanges = { currentTime: new Date() //new value to save in the state }; this.setState(stateChanges); //apply the state changes and re-render! } render() { return ( &lt;div> &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}>What time is it right now&lt;/button> &lt;p>The time is {this.state.currentTime.toLocaleTimeString()}&lt;/p> &lt;/div> ); } } The setState() method will “merge” the values of its parameter into the Component’s state field; in the above example, the alarmSound value will not be modified when the button is pressed; only the value for currentTime will be changed. If you want to change multiple values at the same time, you can include multiple keys in the parameter to setState(). Also note that this merging is “shallow”—if you wanted to change a state value that was an array (e.g., this.state = { comments:[...] }), you would need to set a brand new version of that array (that could be a modified version of the previous state; see below). Importantly, you must use the setState() method to change the state; you cannot assign a new value to the this.state instance variable directly. This is because the React framework uses that method to not only adjust the instance variable, but also to cause the Component to “re-render”. When the state has finished being updated, React will re-render the Component (causing it’s render() method to be called again), and merging the updated rendering into the page’s DOM. React does this merging in a highly efficient manner, changing the elements that have actually updated—this is what makes React so effective for large scale systems. Remember: calling setState() will cause the render() method to be called again, and it will access the updated this.state values! Never call setState() directly from inside of render()! That will cause an infinite recursive loop. The render() method must remain “pure” with no side effects. Moreover, the setState() method is asynchronous. Calling the method only sends a “request” to update the state; it doesn’t happen immediately. This is because React will “batch” multiple requests to update the state of Components (and so to rerender them) together—that way if your app needs to make lots of small changes at the same time, React only needs to regenerate the DOM once, providing a significant performance boost. //An Component with a callback that doesn't handle asynchronous state changes class CounterWithError extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { count: 3 //initial value } } handleClick = () => { this.setState({count: 4}); //change `count` to 4 console.log(this.state.count); //will output \"3\"; state has not changed yet! } //... } In this example, because setState() is asynchronous, you can’t immediately access the updated state after calling the function. If you want to use that updated value, you need to do so in the render() method, which will be called again once the state has finished being updated. Because setState() calls are asynchronous and may be batched, if you wish to update a state value based on the current state (e.g., to have a counter increase), you need to instead pass the setState() method a callback function as an argument (instead of an Object of new values). The callback function will be passed the “current” state (and props), and must return the Object that you wish to merge into the state: //An example button click callback class Counter extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { count: 0 } //initial value } handleClick = () => { //setState is passed an anonymous callback function this.setState((currentState, currentProps) => { //return the Object to \"merge\" into the state let stateChanges = {count: currentState.count + 1}; //increment count return stateChanges; }) } //... } While trying to use this.state directly in a call to setState() will sometimes work, best practice is to instead use a callback function as above when the new state value depends on the old. D.4 The Component Lifecycle A react component’s state is initialized in the constructor (when the component is first instantiated), and then usually modified in response to user events (by calling the setState() method). But there are a number of other “events” that occur during the life of a Component—such as the “events” of when the Component is added to the DOM (“mounted”) or removed from the DOM (“unmounted”). For example, you should only download data when there is a Component on the screen to display that data (after the Component has been added to the DOM), and to “clean up” any listeners or timers when the Component is removed. It is possible to define functions will execute at such these events, allowing you to perform specific actions as the React framework manipulates the DOM. These functions are called lifecycle methods—they are methods that are executed at different stages of the Component’s “lifecycle”. You override these lifecycle methods in order to specify what code you want to run at those events. Lifecycle methods will be automatically executed by the React framework; you never directly call these methods (the same way you never directly call render()—which is itself a lifecycle method!) React components have a number of different lifecycle methods, the most common of which are illustrated below: //A generic component class MyComponent extends Component { //The constructor is called when the Component is instantiated, but before_body //it is added to the DOM (on the screen) constructor(props){ super(props) //initialize state here! } //This method is called when the Component has been added to the DOM (and //is visible on the screen). This occurs _after_ the first `render()` call. componentDidMount() { //do (asynchronous) setup work, including AJAX requests, here! } //This method is called when a Component is being \"re-rendered\" with a //new set of props. This is a less common method to override componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) { //do additional \"re-setup\" work (including updated AJAX requests) here! } //This method is called when the Component is about to be removed from the DOM //(and thus will no longer be visible on the screen) componentWillUnmount() { //do (asynchronous) cleanup work here! } } For more details on the specific usages (and parameters!) of these methods, see the official API documentation. Note that you are not required to include these methods in a Component. However, they are required to correctly perform asynchronous functions such as AJAX requests, as described below. Lifecycle Example: Fetching Data via AJAX One of the most common use of lifecycle callback functions is when accessing data asynchronously, such as when fetching data via an AJAX request (such a described in Chapter 14). This section provides details about how to asynchronously load data within a React class component. Remember that the fetch() function downloads data asynchronously. Thus if you want to download some data to display, it may take a while to arrive. You don’t want React to have to “wait” for the data (since React is designed to be fast). Thus the best practice is to send the fetch() request for data, and then when the data has been downloaded, call the setState() method to update the Component with the downloaded data. (The Component can initialize its state as an “empty array” of data). Because fetch() will eventually call the setState() method, you can’t send the AJAX from the Component’s constructor. That’s because setState() will eventually render the Component, which involves updating something that has been added to the DOM. In the constructor, the Component has been instantiated, but has not yet been added to the DOM—thus you can’t update its state yet! If the data ends up downloading before the Component is mounted, you will get an error that you cannot re-render an unmounted Component! Instead, you should always send your (initial) fetch() requests from the componentDidMount() lifecycle method. This way the data will only be downloaded once the Component has actually been added to the DOM, and so is available for re-rendering. This structure is shown in the example below: class MyComponent extends Componet { constructor(props){ super(props); this.state = { data: [] //initialize data as \"empty\" }; } componentDidMount() { fetch(dataUri) //send AJAX request .then((res) => res.json()) .then((data) => { let processedData = data.filter(...).map(...) //do desired processing this.setState({data: processedData}) //change the state, and re-render }) } render() { //Map the data values into DOM elements //Note that this works even before data is loaded (when the array is empty!) let dataItems = this.state.data.map((item) => { return &lt;li key={item.id}>{item.value}&lt;/li>; //return DOM version of datum }) //render the data items (e.g., as a list) return &lt;ul>{dataItems}&lt;/ul>; } } In the above example, the this.state.data is initialized as an empty array; this will render() just fine (it produces an empty list). Once the Component is mounted, the data will be downloaded and processed, and then saved as an updated state value. Calling setState() will cause the Component to re-render, so that the data will be displayed as desired! While technically it means the Component is rendering twice, React can batch these requests together so that if the data downloads fast enough, the user will not notice. Resources The Component Lifecycle State and Lifecycle "],["css-in-js.html", "E CSS in JS E.1 Why CSS in JS? E.2 React Inline Styles E.3 Aphrodite E.4 CSS Modules Resources", " E CSS in JS This chapter discusses writing CSS in JS, a technique by which CSS styles and classes are defined in JavaScript rather than in separate CSS files. This technique is particularly common and useful in React, and solves a number of problems found in managing the styling of large web projects. E.1 Why CSS in JS? In November 2014, Facebook’s Christopher Chedeau gave a talk outlining many of the issues that occur when trying to develop CSS for a large application: A slide from Chedeau’s talk. Click the image to view the entire deck. In short, the talk points out how defining CSS classes in fact defines global variables: because stylesheets are loaded across the entire page, each class definition is effectively “global” and available to each Component within that page. If you define a class .button somewhere in your CSS, then every Component has access to the .button class. This becomes a problem when you want to support many different components. For example, you couldn’t use .button for multiple buttons that are all styled very differently. Instead, you would need to define different classes for each button… and be careful to make sure that the names don’t “conflict” (e.g., you don’t try defining a .button-submit for two different kinds of submit buttons!). You can use careful naming schemes (such as BEM) to make sure that your names don’t conflict, but this requires a lot of developer discipline and extra thinking—and one mistake can lead to difficult to track bugs! Moreover, CSS rules are global variables that include implicit details in their ordering (e.g., rules later in the stylesheet will override earlier ones). This is a problem when you’re trying to load lots of different style sheets for different Components—which may be loaded in different orders or even asynchronously so you don’t know which stylesheet will be loaded first! The proposed solution to this problem is to define CSS style and class definition in JavaScript as JavaScript variables, and then using a library or build tool to convert those variables into properly name-spaced CSS classes that are included in the rendered DOM. This allow each Component to define its own styling (it’s just a JavaScript variable) without worrying about conflicting global variables. Although the CSS and JavaScript will no longer be quite as separated, in the end the code you write will be simpler and easier to intuit. However, the DOM that these techniques produce will often look a lot messier (e.g., in the developer tools), with more complex class names or vast amounts of inline styling. This is generally an acceptable trade-off: the DOM isn’t directly visible to most users, and is even ignored by screen readers. Chedeau’s talk and its solution were hugely influential, marking a major shift in how web developers thought about CSS. It led to the creation of a large number of projects that provide a different ways of including CSS in JS. These libraries all do mostly the same thing, but use different syntax to solve the problem of making it easier to develop non-global CSS styles. E.2 React Inline Styles The easiest way to include CSS in JS using React is to use its built-in support for inline styling. You can define a CSS rule as a JavaScript object: /* CSS version */ h1 { font-family: 'Helvetica'; color: white; background-color: #333; } /* JavaScript version */ const h1Style = { fontFamily: 'Helvetica', color: 'white', backgroundColor: '#333' } This coincidentally requires only a few changes from how you would normally write CSS properties: you need to camelCase property names like when you refer to DOM styling (since - isn’t a legal character in JavaScript variables); you need to put all property values in quotes, and you use , instead of ; to separate properties in the object literal. You can then apply this object to a particular element by specifying it as the style attribute using JSX: &lt;h1 style={h1Style}/>Hello World!&lt;/h1> This is not actually defining a rule (it won’t apply to all &lt;h1&gt; elements), but rather is using inline styling to apply the style to only a particular element. Normally, in non-React contexts, inline styling (specifying CSS properties in an element’s style attribute) is considered bad practice. It is difficult to modify and maintain, and leads to code duplication and poor cohesion (with style rules spread out across the program). This is part of why CSS-in-JS is considered “special”: it takes what is usually bad practice and shows how, when used in a particular way (in React), it can actually produce better code! You can even use JavaScript objects to namespace particular “style” objects, allowing you to produce something akin to CSS classes (where you can organize and apply lots of properties at once): const styles = { success: { backgroundColor: 'green', color: 'white' }, failure: { backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'white' } } //... &lt;button style={styles.success}>You win!&lt;/button> &lt;button style={styles.failure}>You lose.&lt;/button> Note that these aren’t real CSS classes, but rather are simply names given to styles that are applied inline. Thus you wouldn’t refer to this button as .success (or even .style.success)—it is just a classless button that has some styles applied! E.3 Aphrodite React inline styles allow you to specify styling without creating global variables, but don’t provide actual CSS classes. This means that you lose some semantic meaning (since you can’t determine e.g., if a button is a “success” button just from the rendered DOM). You also lose the ability to handle more complex CSS rules, such as pseudo-classes (particularly ones like :hover or :active) and media queries. For these features, you instead will need to use a third-party library for support CSS-in-JS. There are a wide variety of options for libraries that can be used for author robust CSS-in-JS. One of the cleanest (in the author’s opinion) of these libraries is Aphrodite, which is developed and maintained by developers at Khan Academy. This library allows you to specify CSS classes as JavaScript objects, and then apply those classes to a React element via the className attribute as normal. You specify a collection of style classes by using the StyleSheet.create() method supplied by the library. This method is passed an object whose keys are the “class names”, similar to in the example above. You then reference the “classes” from this object by using the library’s css() function: import { StyleSheet, css } from 'aphrodite'; const styles = StyleSheet.create({ success: { backgroundColor: 'green', color: 'white' }, failure: { backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'white' } }); //... &lt;button className={css(styles.success)}>You win!&lt;/button> &lt;button className={css(styles.failure)}>You lose.&lt;/button> Note that classes are still name-spaced (e.g., styles.success, not just success), you you pass the result of the css() function to the className property. The Aphrodite library will take this StyleSheet you have defined and use it to automatically generate CSS class rules which are injected into the page, just as if you had to written them inside of a .css file! The above JSX code will produce DOM elements: &lt;button class=\"success_c72tod\">You win!&lt;/button> &lt;button class=\"failure_cioc8l\">You lose.&lt;/button> Note that the class names start with the name you gave it, but have a number of additional characters at the end (the _c72tod after success). These characters are a hash of the CSS properties contained within that classname, and are used to distinguish between different classes after they have been injected into the page and thus have become “global” variables. In effect, this library will automatically produce “unique names” for each CSS class you define (differentiated by a deterministic hash at the end), so you don’t need to worry about the success class in one Component interfering with the success class in another. Aphrodite will also let you specify pseudo-selectors and media queries. These are specified as properties of the classes they should apply to; the name of that property is (a string of) the pseudo-selector or media query, and the value of that property is another object containing the CSS properties to apply: const styles = StyleSheet.create({ //... hover: { ':hover': { backgroundColor:'gray' } }, responsive: { '@media (min-width:598px)': { fontSize:'2rem' } } }); This is different from how you normally define media queries: rather than specifying a media query with a block containing the classes it should apply, you specify a class whose block contains the media query. You can pass multiple style classes (or arrays of classes) into the css() method, and they will automatically be combined into a single unique style: //pass multiple styles into `css()` &lt;button className={css(styles.success, styles.hover)}/>You win!&lt;/button> This will render an element with the DOM: &lt;button class=\"success_c72tod-o_O-hover_2nsohz\">You win!&lt;/button> Note here that the success and hover classes have been concatenated into a single class (using -o_O- as a separator); this is to avoid any “ordering” issues—ensuring that the hover options are always applied after the success options. Aphrodite supports a few other features and edge cases, see the documentation for details. Aphrodite is just one of many different CSS-in-JS libraries, all of which have their own syntax. But almost all of them will either generate an inline style to inject into an element, or will produce their own injected stylesheet with auto-generated class names. In either case, you can focus on just styling the components without worrying about the CSS stepping on its own toes! E.4 CSS Modules Another popular approach to solving the “global scoping” problem with CSS is to utilize CSS Modules. Rather than converting JavaScript objects into CSS styles and injecting them into the page, with CSS Modules you write your class definitions in .css files as normal. The CSS Modules then post-processes the .css files at build time (similar to how SASS works), converting the CSS classes into locally scoped versions. These locally scoped classes are then imported as JavaScript objects so that they can be referenced in a manner similar to React Inline Styles: /* app-styles.css */ .success { background-color: green; color: white; } .failure { background-color: red; color: white; } /* App.js */ import styles from './app-styles.css' //... &lt;button className={styles.success}>You win!&lt;/button> &lt;button className={styles.failure}>You lose.&lt;/button> This will render DOM elements with unique, locally-scoped class names (similar to what Aphrodite does): &lt;button class=\"src-___App__success___1t37A\">You win!&lt;/button> &lt;button class=\"src-___App__failure___2BnXi\">You lose.&lt;/button> Overall, CSS Modules has the advantages of letting you write styles in .css files as usual (it’s clear where your CSS is located), can run slightly faster (since in the end, it’s just a CSS file loaded as normal), and include a few extra features that supports easy composition of classes (similar to that provided by SASS). Ejecting from Create React App CSS Modules is a post-processor that “compiles” your CSS at build time, rather than at run time. Thus in order to utilize CSS Modules, you need to configure your application’s “build system” to modularize the CSS. So far, you’ve utilized Create React App to provide a no-configuration build system (using webpack behind the scenes). However, Create React App doesn’t support CSS modules by default—you need to modify the provided Webpack system to include the modularization step. In order to modify the Webpack configuration build into Create React App, you will need to eject it. This process will change your project so that the Webpack configuration files are included as part of the source code, rather than loaded from a a single external library (react-scripts). Ejecting will allow you to modify how your React projects are built. Ejecting is a one-way operation! Once you have “extracted” the build configurations, it’s impossible to put them back (short of creating a new app and copying the files over). Be sure you want to do this! Note that if you really don’t want to eject, there are other, more fragile solutions. In order to eject your configuration information, run the following command: cd path/to/app # from the app folder npm run eject This will create two new folders in your project: scripts (which contains the build and start scripts, e.g., what happens when you run npm start), and config/ (which contains the build configuration files). The Webpack configuration files specifically can be found at config/webpack.config.dev.js (configuration for the development server) and config/webpack.config.prod.js (configuration for production builds). In order to support CSS Modules, you will need to modify both the development and production configuration files. You will need to make a simple change to the Webpack configuration files to support CSS Modules. In the webpack.config.dev.js file, at around line 160 (as of this writing), you will find a “rule” object with the property test: /\\.css$/; this specifies what processing should be applied to .css files. Modify this property: { test: /\\.css$/, use: [ require.resolve('style-loader'), { loader: require.resolve('css-loader'), options: { importLoaders: 1, //ADD THE BELOW TWO PROPERTIES!! modules: true, localIdentName: '[path]___[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]', }, }, //... } These changes modify the already included css-loader loader so that it supports CSS Modules (a feature that is built into the loader, but not enabled by Create React App by default). The second line specify the “pattern” that should be used for generating the compiled class names: in this case, each class is named with the file path where it is used (imported), as well as its imported name. For webpack.config.prod.js, add the same modules: true property to the object dealing with 'css-loader' (around line 180 as of this writing). You should not specify a custom localIdentName, since the default is a shorter hash that will run faster in production (though be less readable). This is the only change you need to make to utilize CSS Modules! Now you can import CSS files into your React components as illustrated above, referring to each class as a property of the imported object which can be assigned to an element’s className attribute! Note that if you want to apply multiple classes to an element, it’s often easiest to utilize the classnames package, which gives you a helper method called classNames that will easily concatenate different classnames for you. See the examples for details. react-css-modules If needing to refer to classes as style.classname is tedious, you can use the react-css-modules library to simplify your React code. This library allows you to “decorate” each component with extra functionality—in particular, it allows you to use a styleName attribute to specify classes directly, without needing to namespace them: import CSSModules from 'react-css-modules'; import styles from './app-styles.css'; class App extends Component { render() { return ( &lt;div> {/* Note the lack of `styles` namespaces! */} &lt;button styleName={success}>You win!&lt;/button> &lt;button styleName={failure}>You lose.&lt;/button> &lt;/div> ); } } export default CSSModules(App, styles); //decorate the App so it reads from the styles It is also possible to automate this decorating by using babel-plugin-react-css-modules, which is a webpack plugin that will automatically process the styleName attributes in the JSX at build time (e.g., it changes how the JSX is compiled!). This provides a significant performance benefit (as well as making your code cleaner). In order to support babel-plugin-react-css-modules, install the library with npm and modify the Webpack config file. Modify the “rule” object with the property test: /\\.(js|jsx|mjs)$/ (which applies to .js files): { test: /\\.(js|jsx|mjs)$/, include: paths.appSrc, loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'), options: { cacheDirectory: true, //ADD THE BELOW PROPERTY!! plugins: [ 'react-css-modules' ] }, } This will apply the plugin whenever the JavaScript files are transpiled, allowing you to utilize the styleName without explicitly using the react-css-modules library. Note that this plugin has a bug whereby changes to how CSS Modules are composed (see below) aren’t applied when the ejected Webpack’s developer server automatically reloads the browser window. See this issue. Composing Classes The other main feature of CSS Modules is the ability to compose classes—that is, you can specify that one CSS class contains all the properties defined by another. This is similar in functionality to the @extends keyword in SASS (though it only affects the classes as they are exported to JavaScript): CSS classes are composed by specifying a composes property with a value that is the name of the class to “include”: .base { font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 2rem; } .success { composes: base; /* include the .base properties */ background-color: green; /* additional properties only for .success */ } .failure { composes: base; background-color: red; /* additional properties only for .failure */ } When applied to the previous example (the two &lt;button&gt; elements), this will render as two separate CSS classes: &lt;button class=\"src-___App__success___1t37A src-___App__base___LeFt5\">You win!&lt;/button> &lt;button class=\"src-___App__failure___2BnXi src-___App__base___LeFt5\">You win!&lt;/button> While you can still specify just a single class in your JavaScript (e.g., className={style.success}), CSS Modules will automatically apply all of the “dependent” styles to your element! Moreover, you can also compose CSS classes across separate files by specifying the value as coming from \"filename\": /* colors.css */ .success { color: green; } /* app-styles.css */ .success { composes: base; composes: success from \"../colors.css\"; /* loads the color from another file */ } This makes it possible to break up your CSS classes into a large number of individual “helper” modules: for example, you could have a colors.css file that defines coloring schemes, a fonts.css file that defines classes that only handle fonts (e.g., .large), a layout.css file that defines classes that only handle layout (e.g., padding-small, margin-top-large), and so forth: /* example from docs */ .element { composes: large from \"./fonts.css\"; composes: dark-text from \"./colors.css\"; composes: padding-all-medium from \"./layout.css\"; composes: subtle-shadow from \"./effect.css\"; } In effect, you can use different files you develop your own set of Bootstrap-style utility classes! This may seem like overkill for a small app, but can be a great help when you’re trying to design a large app (e.g., the size of Facebook) or a want to be able to consistently “theme” related but vastly different apps (think Gmail and Google Drive).

"],["react-native.html", "G React Native G.1 Getting Setup G.2 React Native Apps", " G React Native As a special topic, this chapter provides a brief introduction to React Native, a framework for using React to build mobile applications (e.g., apps for Android or iOS). The React Native framework provides a set of build tools that allow you to compile React code (written in JavaScript) into native mobile code (Java for Android; Objective-C for iOS). This allows you to utilize your existing knowledge of client-side web development to also create mobile apps as if you had written them in their normal development language! Moreover, the same React code can be converted into apps for both iOS and Android (as well as for the web), with you only needing to adjust any platform-specific features. Three platforms for the price of one! This chapter’s explanation mirrors the official tutorial for React Native; see that for more details. G.1 Getting Setup The easiest way to start a new React Native application is to use the create-react-native-app program. This works almost identically to the create-react-app program you know and love, except it will scaffold you a React Native application and provide build scripts utilizes for testing and developing native apps. To use this program install it globally, and then execute it to create a new React Native project in the current folder: create-react-native-app MyNativeApp This scaffolding will include a number of configuration files (see the User Guide for details), but you’ll mostly be interested in App.js, whose default export will be the “root” component of your application (mobile apps are usually designed around a View component that is shown, rather than an index.js style script to execute). create-react-native-app doesn’t currently work with npm version 5.0 or greater. Until this is fixed, the best solution is to use yarn to install and manage react native applications. Note that installing yarn may cause issues with npm that you’d need to resolve: proceed with caution if under a deadline! Alternatively, you can downgrade to an older version of npm using npm install -g npm@4 Running React Native Apps There are a few different ways to “run” and test your application as you’re developing it, depending on the platform (Android or iOS) you’re targeting: For either platform, you can test your React Native code on a physical device by using the Expo app. This is a separate mobile application that “connects” to a server run by the create-react-native-app build scripts, displaying updates to your app in real time. In order to use Expo, install the app on your phone, and then use npm start to begin the development server. The server will show a QR code in the command line that you can scan to have your phone connect to the server (assuming they are on the same wireless network); this will run your developed app on the phone, and even automatically refresh it when you save changes to the file! It is also possible to run your React Native app on virtual devices (e.g., emulators) for either platform. These are “virtual” phones that run on your own computer, allowing you to develop and test mobile apps without needing a specific device. Note that you will need to have the appropriate development environment installed and set up for each platform: Android Studio for Android, and Xcode for iOS. Xcode only runs on MacOS. For Android, you will need to create and start up an emulator with Android Studio: go to Tools &gt; Android &gt; AVD Manager to open up the Android Virtual Device Manager. You can then choose “Create Virtual Device…” in order to launch the wizard to specify a new emulator. You can then install and run an app on the emulator (using Expo) via the npm run android command. You can access the development menu on the device from the notification, or by hitting cmd-m. For iOS, you can start up the Simulator program (it is found inside Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications. If you right-click on the Xcode.app program and select “Show Package Contents”, you will be able to navigate to it). You will then be able to install and run an app on Simulator (using Expo) via the npm run ios command. You can access the development menu on the device by hitting cmd-d. Finally, Expo Snack allows you to develop, test, and run simple React Native apps entirely online! This can be a good way to test out the design or to share code snippets with others. G.2 React Native Apps Writing React Native code uses the same process and techniques as writing normal React code: you define Components that render Views, which themselves are made up of more Components! These components can be passed in props and track state just like in React. In fact, if you look at the default App.js file created by create-react-native-app, you’ll see that it’s just basic React code. However, instead of eventually rendering HTML elements (such as &lt;div&gt; or &lt;button&gt;), React Native apps render one of the framework’s built-in components. Each of these components is able to be “compiled” into a an appropriate “native” version. For example, a &lt;View&gt; is compiled into a &lt;div&gt; element on the web, an android.View element on Android, and a UIView element on iOS. Just as React components almost always return a &lt;div&gt; with some content nested inside of it, React Native components almost always return a &lt;View&gt; with some content nested inside of it. &lt;View&gt; elements are particularly important when styling your app; see below. Other basic components include: &lt;Text&gt; components represent displayed text (similar in purpose to a &lt;p&gt;, though they get compiled into inline &lt;span&gt; elements on the web). All displayed text must be inside one of these elements; you can’t have a “text node” directly under a &lt;View&gt; like you can in HTML. &lt;Text&gt; elements also support cascading styling. &lt;Image&gt; components are used to display images (similar to a &lt;img&gt;). You specify which image to display by passing in a source prop. This can be a remote reference (e.g., https://domain.com/picture.png), or a local image. In order to refer to a local image file, you should import it using Node’s require() method, specifying the path to the image file relative to the Component. This will the build tools to load the file as a data URI when rendering the image, and ensuring that the asset is packaged with the native app correctly. &lt;Image source={ require('./path/to/picture.png') }/> Additionally, you should always specify an accessibilityLabel prop specifying how the image should be read to screen readers (yes, they exist for mobile devices! Blind people also use phones). Styling React Native You customize the appearance of React Native components by specifying styling properties in their style prop, similar to React inline styling. Note that Android and iOS don’t support CSS, so you don’t utilize className in React Native. However, because it’s often useful to organize styles into groups and give them labels, React Native provides a Stylesheet.create() similar to that used by Aphrodite. Defining a stylesheet helps with code organization, as well as providing a more efficient native implementation (since you don’t need to duplicate style objects)—and efficient matters a lot more on resource-constrained mobile devices! Although you specify style properties similar to CSS properties (e.g., with the same property names), React Native stylesheets do not use CSS! In particular, styles do not normally cascade: specifying the fontSize for a &lt;View&gt; will not cause that property to be applied to multiple nested &lt;Text&gt; elements. This feature is missing because styling does not normally cascade in Android and iOS, and React Native can run more effectively by not needing to traverse the element tree to check if each and every property is defined by a parent. Moreover, this means that each component can be better isolated (developed as a stand-alone, drop-in piece of an application), because there is no chance of accidentally inheriting some styling. However, nested &lt;Text&gt; components will inherit from their parents as a convenience, allowing you to easily style parts of a text block (e.g., to make some text highlighted). You can specify an element’s size by setting it’s width and height style properties. These properties should be assigned unitless numbers (you don’t include px or rem). The value measures the number of density-independent pixels, which is a pixel-value that scales based on the resolution (dots-per-inch, or dpi) of the device. This allows the sizing to be consistent on “retina” displays. Any elements that are not given a fixed size—as well as any element positioning—is primarily performed with Flexbox properties! The Flexbox framework allows you to provide a layout that will be consistent across different screen sizes. The “root” element (usually a &lt;View&gt;) of a component is rendered as a “flex item”, but each &lt;View&gt; can also be made into its own “flex container” in order to specify the direction (which defaults to a vertical “column”), size, or spacing of its content: //declare a stylesheet const styles = StyleSheet.create({ outer: { flex: 1; //this View should fill vertical space flexDirection: 'row'; //children should be layed out horizontally } inner: { flex: 1; //take up equal extra space } }) //an example app export default class App { render() { return ( &lt;View style={styles.outer}> &lt;Text style={styles.inner}>Item 1&lt;/Text> &lt;Text style={styles.inner}>Item 2&lt;/Text> &lt;Text style={styles.inner}>Item 2&lt;/Text> &lt;/View> ) } } Interaction React Native apps can be made interactive using a similar process to regular React apps: you specify an event handler which can be used to modify the state and re-render the component. However, The events that you listen for are slightly different with React Native. For example, a &lt;Button&gt; element accepts an onPress property (instead of onClick): &lt;Button onPress={() => this.handlePress()}>Press me!&lt;/Button> Note that the callback is not passed any parameters, so you don’t have an event to work with. In order to get text input, you use a &lt;TextInput&gt; component (which is a lot like an &lt;input type=\"text\"&gt; element in HTML). This element can be made to be a controlled input just like with normal React, though you would use the onChangeText prop to listen for text changes (the callback function will be passed in the updated text): &lt;TextInput placeholder=\"Type something!\" value={this.state.inputValue} onChangeText={ (newText) => this.setState({inputValue:newText}) } /> Lists and Data Information applications often need to display lists of data values (e.g., a list of tasks to complete). While it is possible to map() an array variable to an array of &lt;View&gt; elements to render, Android and iOS support more specific techniques that allow for better responsiveness and efficiency when displayed on mobile devices. For example, these components will automatically render only a “portion” of the list that is currently visible on the small screen, loading new Views into memory only when the user scrolls down to see them. This allows the user to smoothly “flick” through a list of items. You can create such an optimized list in React Native by rendering a &lt;FlatList&gt; component. This component takes two main properties: data, which is an array of data values to “map” into Views; and renderItem, which is a function that does the “mapping” (similar to the render function for react-router): &lt;FlatList data={myDataArray} renderItem={ (args) => &lt;Text>{args.item.text}&lt;/Text> } /> Each element in the data array must contain a key property that React uses to keep track of each item in the list (though you can pass a function that extracts a value as the key to the keyExtractor prop). The actual “data item” will be found in the item property of the callback function’s arguments (the index property will contain the index of that item). However, it’s common to use object destructuring to instead only pass the the specific property of the parameter object: function renderListItem({item}) { //param is `item = args.item` return &lt;Text>{item.text}&lt;/Text>; //can access item directly } function renderWithIndex({item, index}) { //gets two params: args.item and args.index return &lt;Text>{index} - {item.text}&lt;/TEXT>; } If you would like to download data from the internet to display using React Native, you use the fetch() API just like you’ve used in the web! export default class App extends Component { constructor(props){ super(props); this.state = {data:[]} } componentDidMount() { fetch(dataURI) .then((res) => res.json()) .then((data) => { this.setState({data: data}); }) .catch((err) => console.error) } render() { return ( &lt;View> &lt;FlatList data={this.state.data} renderItem={({item}) => &lt;Text>{item.text}&lt;/Text>} /> &lt;/View> ) } } Overall, React Native is simply another way of building (but not implementing!) React applications, and makes heavy use of many of the modern frameworks and techniques (e.g., Flexbox, fetch) discussed throughout this course "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
